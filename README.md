# Mission

I am interested in developing the following areas:

- independent media of the new generation,
- leading movie and gaming industry,
- virtual reality,
- IT sector that works on its own production and includes: blockchain, AI, neurotechnologies and robotics.

Looking for an opportunity to integrate my ideas or unite people to create the future together in selected areas. I have strategies and a project scenario: "how to create an information media magazine and transform it into a company producing its own technologies" and I want to achieve it.

# Description

My idea starts with creating its own territory of free internet. The format of the magazine and social network is being created, as a mobile application and web platform, which can be imagined on the example of flipboard and facebook. The concept of owning a magazine is promising due to the ability to develop independently at its own course and adapt to new needs and trends in the information field.

The focus is on information delivery and producing film and game products. Because proper marketing is the key to success, and a quality product is the confirmation. For this, a professional team is being formed to lead the magazine and create content, developing the platform in stages.

### Required functions:

- Magazine – for strategic purposes, to occupy the place of the leading media in the country. Necessary for advertising, self-promotion, aggressive marketing, and as a regular diary.
- Social network – to unite people with similar views and tastes.
- Donation system – to attract investments for development and content monetization.
- Imageboard forum – to exchange experiences and preserve ready-made solutions for all life cases.
- Platform as a resource – for distributing own production of films, gaming industry, and any other activities.

# Details

Magazine management and steps – the strategy stage – are my separate projects that I can present. Content is being developed specifically for a separate target audience, existing problems are raised, clear examples of solutions are provided, and the audience is engaged.

Key industry products – the production stage – are also my separate projects that I can present. I have a TV show, an animated serial, and a video game. Which, initially, will allow popularizing for the Ukrainian audience and later entering the international market with presentations of future projects for world film festivals and game expos.

### What I can offer:

- Articles offering an alternative development strategy in Ukraine and beyond. Topics related to modern culture and social issues with options for their solution. Humor and gonzo journalism. As a result – competitive media.
- Uncensored space for uniting people who want to change the future in selected areas and a place free from any pressure of bureaucracy, oligarchs, or government structures.
- Marketing approaches for mass distribution.
- Making films, games – for sales and global popularization of culture and art and meeting consumer needs.
- Production of key products and magazine management should confirm all the stated words within one year (opportunity assessment stage).
- Then the development of the production IT sector and automatization, assessing needs and priorities. All technologies can be integrated into this magazine (the reason for the need of its own place).
- And then only more!

### Stages and needs (MVP):

- Foundation – initial capital for team formation and production of key industry products.
- Development strategy – a complete magazine with a forum or integration into an existing platform.
- Launch and evaluation of effectiveness – finalization of vulnerabilities, marketing strategy, and advertising campaign.

The flexibility of my ideas allows integrating them into any existing projects as modification, separate projects, or company scaling. So, if you share similar interests and are open to cooperation, I am ready to discuss. There is a vision, and theoretically, it works. For practice, I need resources.

# Summarizing

This is a complex, multifunctional, and multi-stage project, it is challenging, but it is possible! That's why I chose a magazine for development – it is a powerful tool of mass information and influence, and in Ukraine, with adequate mass media, there are obvious problems (there is no popular and independent, or popular and high-quality), so I see no obstacles to occupy this niche.

Overall, my perspective is focused on the development of scale. To create a state-independent place with its independent ecosystem. With collaboration of various fields, from innovative technologies to creative minds. And if we gather all the best in one place and organize a professional team of critical thinkers and enthusiasts, evolutionary progress will happen naturally. Because nothing is impossible, only the wrong approach!

### To put it simply:

- Magazine – the face of the company. A popular magazine – the voice of the majority. A mega-popular magazine – dictates the rules of development, not being subject to the ban on evolution (there is a strategy).
- Production of cool movies and games – profit (there are scenarios).
- Investing profit in our IT technologies (blockchain, AI, neurotechnologies and robotics) – even more profit (there are ideas).
- Win!
- Risks: In a critical case, there could be only a popular magazine with the ability to sell advertisements, a donation system for investments, and the production of film and game products for sale to other companies. The foundation is preserved and development is possible even in critical conditions.

### Technologies (interested in):

- Blockchain – cryptocurrency operations on the platform, security.
- AI – personal assistant in a journal (help in work, study, entertainment).
- Neurotechnology – study the human brain and integrate it with computer technologies, virtual reality.
- Robotics – automation of complex workflows, prosthetics, own satellites.

### New journalism as a separate form of art

A new narrative of modern breathing, different opinions, truth and dirty realism. A unique presentation of information without censorship – direct, sarcastic, with a character of everyday language writing style, honesty, and simplicity in describing life.

Gonzo journalism – making story diaries from the first person or group of people, immersing oneself in events, becoming part of the history, an unpredictable and experimental style. Diving into the heart of the problem, studying it from inside, or creating specific conditions for its appearance. Subjects dealing with modern culture and social problems.
