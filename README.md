## This project is looking for investment or any help with development and promotion. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to contact me!

# Pitch

I have a great desire to create a social platform (mobile application and web service) for potential development in Ukraine with the ability to go global. It's a new space of endless possibilities, a fresh air of freedom, a multifunctional product for creating anything you want, from technological innovation to personal improvement, all the best of everything in one place!

# Base: Application

Staffed, feature-rich magazine with the ability to create and promote any kind of activity with integrated author support. Also a place for browsing all sorts of information and entertainment. Mostly focused under a mobile app with an extended and accessible web site – on the outside, and on the inside – a huge potential of wanting to join the companies that are moving progress.

### Features and Capabilities:

Modernized magazine redesign, social network, microblogging

Online cinema, video hosting and live streaming

Imageboard and anonymous web forum

- in order to fill with content the section has its own field of activity: Journalism, world events coverage. Movies/Cartoons/Games Industry.

For the wow effect and presentation of the main entry page of the application serve bright and eye-catching posters of actual events. Will be created with original designs and changed depending on the current newsbreak, causing different emotions for public discussion.

# Fields of activity:

### Creative production.

In general, my perspective is focused on the development of scale and collaboration of different spheres of activity, from innovative technologies to creative self-expression. And if we bring all the best and long-known things in one place and create a professional team of critical thinkers and enthusiasts, the jump in evolutionary process will happen all by itself, which will allow us to create a new history of culture, art and technological growth in Ukraine and world industry.

Primary Plan: Creation and re-engineering of the IT sector. Computer games development, making movies, cartoons (for which there are ready made ideas and scripts to start) + studio of exact translation and voice acting. Additionally: automation of all obsolete life processes and much more.

### Journalism.

A new narrative of modern breathing, different opinions, truth and dirty realism. A peculiar presentation of information without censorship – direct, sarcastic, with the character of everyday language writing style, honesty and simplicity in describing life, featuring both heroes and anti-heroes.

Gonzo Journalism, making story diaries from the first person or group of people, immersing oneself in events, becoming part of the history, an unpredictable and experimental style. Diving into the depths of the absurdity of an issue, studying it from inside, or creating specific conditions for its appearance. Subjects dealing with contemporary culture and social issues.

# Development: Minimal Viable Product

The initial launch includes a redesign of the magazine with a feature-rich social network inside, a Journalism section and a staffed Imageboard with ready-made information for a variety of situations, together with ideas and promotion of the rest, which helps to engage the audience and further development.

# Why(?). Motive

All current social networks have turned or are turning into “bygone era TVs'', with censorship to the point of absurdity and a stream of endless advertising all around that clutters the content. That's why we need to revise the obvious and create a new open platform, a shift in direction and breath of fresh air.

For Ukraine it will be the first of such a place format, where everything will be focused on unleashing the creative potential of personality, freedom of expression and promotion of a modern world view. And the usual entertainment as well.

This application will combine the best features in a convenient format – without unnecessary functions and useless things. With a stylish modern minimalist design and futuristic offshoot with maximum responsiveness to the consumer.

In the process of further formation and the right approach to implementation, this place will perfectly occupy its niche for the production of all above listed and newly invented, becoming a leading area, a voice of consciousness, highlighting the desire to popularize the development in the country.
