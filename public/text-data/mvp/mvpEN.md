## **New Journalism**

A modern narrative of fresh breath, journalism as a separate form of art, different opinions, truth and dirty realism. A unique presentation of information without censorship â€“ direct, sarcastic, with a character of everyday language writing style, honesty, and simplicity in describing life.

## Gonzo journalism

Making story diaries from the first person or group of people, immersing oneself in events, becoming part of the history, an unpredictable and experimental style. Diving into the heart of the problem, studying it from inside, or creating specific conditions for its appearance. Subjects dealing with modern culture and social problems.
