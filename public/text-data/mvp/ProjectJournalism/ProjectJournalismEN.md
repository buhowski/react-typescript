## Content Philosophy

### New Journalism

This project has absolutely nothing in common with “journalism” — it’s a modern work of art. The author is an artist and a zero-fucks-given attitude: some paint with shit, I paint with words. 

This is about a modern narrative with a fresh breath, diverse reflections, the gutter truth, and dirty realism. A unique way of presenting uncensored information: direct, sarcastic, with the tone of everyday language, honesty, and simplicity in describing life.

### Gonzo Journalism

Keeping first-person narrative diaries, plunging into events and becoming part of the story. It's an unpredictable and experimental style that allows you to dive into the very hell of a problem, studying the issue from the inside. The topics are connected with modern culture and social problems.

### Future Exposition of a Verbal Gallery

- What's for breakfast? Your favorite shit — an exploration of the absurdity of human behavior through the consumption of “healthy nutrition” from unhealthy information sources. And how feasting on someone else’s filth lets people scold those who refuse to eat from their buffet.
- Favorite sport — shifting responsibility: from child owners to the system, from the system to society, and from society to the entertainment industry, whose direct task is to stage Sodom and Gomorrah and call it normal.
- We ain't even fuckin' needin' your Euro-Soviet — a manifesto on how bureaucracy and restrictions (which Ukraine will absorb from Europe) slow down development, while true freedom lies in partnership, not in dependence on an outdated system.
- The system’s shelf life has expired — a requiem before the global purge and the birth of a new millennium.
- The theorem of cyclicity: how the legacy of hatred passes the baton to a new war, and the fascism of prohibition becomes one of its modern manifestations, turning every "never again" into "again and again".
- "What God wanted to say?", "Who is right in the chain of evolution?", "An interview with Planet Earth", and all the dimensions of human consciousness — from the subconscious to the surprises of the future genetic lottery.
