### New Journalism

This project has absolutely nothing to do with "journalism" — it is a modern work of art. The author is an artist and an anarcho-ironist: some paint with shit, I paint with the letters of chaos theory.

- We ain't even fuckin' needin' your Euro-Soviet — a manifesto on how bureaucracy and restrictions (which Ukraine will consume from Europe) hinder development, while true freedom is a partnership, not dependence on an outdated system.
- The system’s shelf life has expired — a requiem before the global purge and the birth of a new millennium.
- The theorem of cyclicality: how the legacy of hatred passes the baton to a new war, and the fascism of prohibition becomes one of its modern manifestations, turning every "Never Again" into "Again and Again”.
- “What did God want to say?”, “Who is right in the evolutionary chain?”, “An interview with planet Earth,” and all the dimensions of human consciousness — from the subconscious to the surprises of the future genetic lottery…
