## Current Position

I am currently at the stage of finding partners for the team — in my opinion, this is the most difficult phase. The entire idea will be easily implemented if we manage to find the right people and place them in the right positions. Then the perpetual motion machine will start to work.

## Quick Action Plan

I see the following structure:

### Start

Three (the more, the better) relatively popular content creators are brought on as partners. [Presentation projects](/self-presentation) are filmed and feedback is analyzed — and this process continues until a path to the necessary investment for the magazine's MVP development is opened.

### **Investment & "The Corp" Phase**

Once sufficient investment is secured, the development of the magazine and the ["The Corp .!.”](/the-corp) series phase begins. This becomes a powerful stage of self-promotion and a demonstration of the quality of future content, expanding the audience and attracting new investments.

### Scaling

Scaling happens in parallel with this. The next phase involves working with the core audience, who are given a choice of which project to do next. This encourages initiative from viewers, expanding the audience even more and bringing in new investments.

## Prospects

I imagine that within one year it is possible to attract the attention of absolutely everyone to this kind of motivational environment. In essence, we will be doing the same thing as we would separately, but by uniting in one place, we can build a new empire. And here I am confident that we will pay for ourselves for at least the infinite development of such a future.
