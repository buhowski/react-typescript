# Another Dimension

***Status:** Seeking Mad Geniuses*

## Current Position

I'm currently looking for team partners — in my opinion, this is the most challenging phase. The entire idea will be easily realized if I can find the right people and place them in the right positions. Then, a perpetual motion machine will start running.

## Quick Action Plan

I envision the following structure:

### Start

Three (the more, the better) relatively popular content creators are brought on as partners. [Presentation projects](/self-presentation) are filmed, feedback is analyzed — and this process continues until a path opens for the necessary investments to develop an MVP Journal.

### Investment and "The Corp" Phase

As soon as sufficient investments are secured, the journal's development begins, along with "[The Corp .!.](/the-corp)” series phase. This becomes a powerful stage of self-promotion and a demonstration of the future content's quality, expanding the audience and attracting new investments. The series will be filmed from the beginning until the project has run its course.

### Scaling

Concurrently, scaling efforts will be underway. The next phase involves working with a core audience, who will be given the choice of which project to pursue next. This encourages audience initiative, further expanding reach and bringing in new investments.

## Outlook

I imagine that within one year, it will be possible to capture the attention of absolutely everyone with this kind of motivational environment. Essentially, we'll be doing the same things we'd do separately, but united in one place, which can build a new empire. And I'm confident that we'll at least break even on the infinite development of such a future.
