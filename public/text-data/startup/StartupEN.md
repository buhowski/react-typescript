## Foreword

I have a huge vision of the entire picture – to create a corporation focused on developing the areas that need it. The pieces of this picture are my individual projects, which I want to monetize, investing the profits into my own technologies and opening opportunities for like-minded people. Or, to find those who will help bring my ideas to life, or join forces for collaborative work.

Presentations of all projects are available in the navigation. Below is the logic behind building this system.

## Mission

I've created strategies and project scenario: "How to create an information media magazine in Ukraine and transform it into a company producing its own technologies" and I am seeking investments for its implementation, or the opportunity to integrate my ideas with your help and find like-minded individuals and partners for cooperation to create the future in selected areas:

- independent media of the new generation,
- leading movie and gaming industry,
- virtual reality,
- IT sector, which includes: blockchain, AI, neurotechnology and robotics.

## Description

My idea begins with creating its own free internet territory. It takes the format of a magazine and social network, as a mobile application and web platform, which can be imagined on the examples of Vogue, Flipboard, Facebook, Reddit. The concept of its own magazine is promising because of the possibility to develop independently on its own course and adapt to new needs and trends in the information field.

The focus is on presenting information and producing individual projects. To achieve this, an initial team is being formed – responsible for running the journal and creating content, gradually developing the platform step by step.

### Required Functions

- Journal / Magazine – for strategic purposes, to claim a leading media position in the country. Essential for advertising, self-promotion, aggressive marketing, and audience engagement.
- Social network – to connect people with similar views and tastes.
- Imageboard forum – for sharing experience and preserving ready-made solutions for all situations.
- Donation system – to attract investments for development and content monetization.
- Platform as a resource – for distributing original projects.

## Details

Running the journal and step-by-step implementation of the strategy are separate projects, with examples appearing here: [MVP](https://buhowski.dev/mvp). Content is created with a specific target audience in mind, addressing current issues and offering clear solutions that help attract and retain the audience.

Key industry products represent production stages, presented as separate scripts, with project presentations here: [Films](https://buhowski.dev/films), [Video Games](https://buhowski.dev/games). Initially, this will help gain popularity among the Ukrainian audience, and later – expand to the international level with presentations of future projects at global film festivals and gaming exhibitions.

### What I Can Offer

- Provocative articles that challenge the usual order of things, presenting alternative development strategies for Ukraine and the world. Topics related to contemporary culture and social issues, with possible solutions. Humor and gonzo journalism. A media product unafraid to be different.
- A free space without censorship or suffocating control – a place for those who reject bureaucratic systems and want to change the future. Free from pressure by oligarchs or government structures.
- Aggressive marketing strategies for large-scale audience reach.
- Films and games production as tools for global dissemination of culture and art, satisfying the interests of both creators and audiences.
- The production of key projects and running the journal will confirm all stated goals within the first year and ensure the attraction of new investments for at least the next 5 years (evaluation phase).
- The next step – IT and automation with direct integration of technologies into the journal (which justifies the need for a dedicated space for experiments and development).
- And only more to come!

### Stages and Needs (MVP)

- Foundation – team, strategy, initial funding for key projects.
- Development – creation of a minimum viable magazine.
- Launch and Scaling – result analysis, improvement, promotion

The flexibility of my ideas allows them to be integrated into any existing projects – as a modification, a separate project, or company scaling. If you share similar interests and are open to collaboration, I am ready to discuss. The vision exists and theoretically works. Resources are needed for implementation.

## Summarizing

This is a complex, multifunctional, and multi-stage project that presents challenges but is entirely feasible! For development, I chose a magazine – a powerful tool for mass information and influence. In Ukraine (and beyond), there are evident issues with mass media (magazines): a lack of publications that are both popular and independent, or popular and high-quality, or relatable to the younger generation. Therefore, I am confident that occupying the niche as a new-generation media outlet is not a problem.

### To Put it Simply

- Magazine – the face of the company. A popular magazine – the voice of the majority. A mega-popular magazine – sets the direction of development rather than adapting to prohibitions (there is a strategy).
- Production of quality films and games – a source of profit (there are scripts).
- Profit is reinvested into own IT technologies – even greater profit (there are ideas).
- Win!
- Risks: in the worst-case scenario, it may result in only a popular magazine with the ability to earn from advertising, a donation system for investments, and the production of film-game products for sale to other companies. Nonetheless, the foundation remains, and development is possible even under critical conditions.

### Technologies (interested in)

- Blockchain – cryptocurrency operations on the platform, own cryptocurrency, security.
- AI – personal assistant in the magazine: assistance in education, work, and entertainment. Without artificial restrictions, with customization options.
- Neurotechnologies – studying brain function and integration with digital technologies. Virtual and augmented reality.
- Robotics – automation of complex processes, modern prosthetics, development of own satellites.

## Conclusion

Overall, my perspective is focused on scaling up – to create a place independent from the state with its own ecosystem, collaborating across various fields: from innovative technologies to creative thinking. If we gather the best in one place and organize a professional team of critical thinkers and enthusiasts, an evolutionary leap will happen naturally. Because nothing is impossible – only the wrong approach!
