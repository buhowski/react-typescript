# Presentation

## Preface

I've got a grand vision of the overall picture — creating a corporation to develop areas close to my worldview, which inspire me and provide space for ideas, are locally underdeveloped, but possess high-profit potential (magazine, media, film and gaming industry, IT sector).

The pieces of this picture are my individual projects, which I plan to monetize and reinvest the profits into developing my own technologies, creating opportunities for like-minded people.

I'm also looking for those who will help bring my ideas to life and team up, combining efforts and shared interests for a partnership.

Project presentations are available in the navigation. Below is the logic behind building this corporation.

## For a Fuller Picture

### Problems

We see a world where the system is built to constantly generate problems — because it simply can’t exist without them. Bureaucracy interferes with every part of our lives because that’s its direct purpose. Politics has legalized mass murder, and some states still haven’t grasped what Orwell was really trying to say.

The truth is, most people on this planet live below an average standard. And this structure of the world — this way of living — doesn’t work for everyone. Especially not for those who consciously want a family but are surrounded by an unpredictably hostile environment. There are also those who were born “by default,” whose desires and goals clash with their opportunities and the basic rules they’re given. And that’s where things start to get interesting…

### The Solution

The system works the way it needs to — that’s why it functions. It’s not my job to change or improve it.

My idea is just to highlight what, in my view, is outside the competence of mainstream information sources; what remains unsaid; what’s taboo; or what might actually help someone.

It’s about breaking away from all the possible “sticks in the spokes.” About having the freedom to speak without fear of being banned. About being able to explore, create cool ideas, experiment with new technologies, and most importantly, not forget to have fun.

And to make all of that happen on your own terms — this corporation is meant to be exactly that kind of space.

## Mission

I've developed a strategy and project scenario: "How to create an information and entertainment media journal and transform it into a company that produces its own technologies.”

For this realization, I'm seeking investments or the opportunity to integrate these ideas into existing projects. My goal is to find a team and partners to shape the future in the following areas:

- Informational-entertainment magazine
- Next-generation independent media
- Leading Film and Gaming Industry
- Virtual Reality
- IT sector: blockchain, artificial intelligence, neurotechnology, robotics

## Description

My idea starts with creating a unique space on the internet. It's about a new format of combining a magazine and a social network, in the form of a mobile app and web version. Think of it as something between Vogue, Flipboard, Facebook/Instagram, Reddit.

The concept of owning a magazine is promising because it allows us to set our own direction and quickly adapt to changes and trends in the information field.

In my opinion, I have enough knowledge, understanding, and practical experience to consider the needs of different audiences and, from a psychological perspective, find effective solutions for adapting content and strategy.

The focus is on high-quality content that builds our image and attracts an audience, along with developing our own products that generate revenue. To achieve this, an initial team is being formed to run the magazine and gradually develop the platform.

### Required Functions

- Journal / Magazine — for strategic purposes, to claim a leading media position in the country. Essential for advertising, self-promotion, aggressive marketing, and audience engagement
- Social network — to connect people with similar views and interests
- Imageboard forum — for sharing experience and preserving ready-made solutions for all occasions
- Donation system — to attract investments for development and content monetization
- Platform as a resource — for distributing original projects

### What I Can Offer

- Provocative articles that challenge the usual order of things — offering alternative strategies for the development of Ukraine and the world. Topics related to contemporary culture and social issues, with solutions proposed
- Counterculture, humor, and gonzo journalism. A media product unafraid to be different — one that shapes events rather than just reporting on them
- A free space without censorship or suffocating control (with explanations of why certain things hinder development)
- A place of permissiveness with a smart approach and a forward-thinking strategy that respects personal boundaries — for those who reject the bureaucratic system and strive to change the future. Free from oligarchic or governmental pressure
- Aggressive marketing strategies for large-scale audience coverage
- Films and games production — as tools for global dissemination of culture and art, satisfying the interests of both creators and the audience
- The next step — IT and automation with technology integration directly into the journal (the reason for the need of our own place for experiments and development)
- And only more to come!

## Partnership Model

To build a solid foundation, it’s key to team up with leading influencers and content creators — those with a strong presence in their field and an active audience.

### Principles of Collaboration

- Open interaction, synergy, and respect for personal freedom — no hierarchies or useless fluff, with a shared sense of humor and a rock’n’roll drive
- Equal partnership and co-ownership, where each participant receives a stake in the corporation and takes part in the platform’s strategic development
- Each partner will have their own channel with full functionality for creating content: posts, photos, videos, reels, and more
- The creator’s main content gradually moves to the magazine, while external social networks remain secondary — used freely for outreach and audience redirection (with no usage restrictions)

Initially, only partners will be able to publish in the magazine — to maintain quality and shape the core audience. Later, anyone will be able to create a page, publish in a convenient format, and access monetization options.

### Mutual Benefit

- For partners: nothing to lose — only new opportunities, income growth, a stake in the corporation, and the freedom to launch their own departments without the limits typical of other platforms
- For the magazine: rapid audience growth, quality content, and a strong team of like-minded creators
- For the audience: a new media space with freedom of expression and dynamic formats for interaction

## Audience Engagement Mechanism

At the core is a psychographic approach that divides the audience into several typical segments. The focus is on key groups:

- Core content — original, created for personal satisfaction, with a focus on common sense and nonconformity. Targeted at creative thinkers, tech enthusiasts, and fans of post-irony and eclectic humor
- Additional formats — stylistic and format variations tailored to the interests of other segments, such as TikTok and meme culture
- Audience expansion — launching new key formats to reach additional groups, such as education-focused and business analytics content

This modular approach allows for combining various formats, ensuring deep engagement and maximum retention of the intended audience.

## Business Model

- Subscriptions: Always Free / Premium Special — free access for everyone, with extended features for premium users, including early access to premieres and original film projects
- Creator monetization — built-in tools for earning: custom subscriptions, donations, direct content sales, and other support models
- Sale of original projects and exclusive content: games, videos, books, art objects, and more
- Donations and voluntary support — users support the project however they want or commission custom content, helping develop new formats
- Ads and partner programs tailored to the audience — respectful, non-intrusive ads with sponsors and brands that share the platform’s values
- Monetization of new technologies — through VR, AR, and interactive AI content for entertainment, work, and education

## Details

Strategy implementation is divided into separate projects. Details here: [Another Dimension](/mvp).

Key industry products are presented as individual scenarios. Presentations here: [Films](/films), [Video Games](/games).

The [Self-Presentation Projects](/self-presentation) are pilot stages, possibly without funding, serving as the first phases of capability evaluation, which should confirm all declared intentions through feedback. They pave the way to launching key ideas and creating the magazine, and will also help attract new investments for at least the next five years.

Initially, this will help gain traction with a Ukrainian audience, and later — enter the global market with project presentations.

### Stages and Needs

- Foundation — forming a team, launching the self-presentation projects, preliminary evaluation, and initial funding for key projects
- MVP Development — creating a minimum viable magazine with starter content and functionality
- Launch and Scaling — analyzing results, improvement, promoting, and attracting larger investments

The flexibility of my ideas makes them easy to integrate into existing projects — as a modification, a separate project, or a way to scale a company. If you share similar interests and are open to collaboration — I’m ready to discuss. The vision exists, and theoretically, it works. Resources are needed for implementation.

## Summarizing

This is a complex, multifunctional, and multi-stage project that’s challenging — but entirely achievable! I’ve chosen a magazine as the core of development — a powerful tool for mass communication and influence.

In Ukraine (and beyond), there are evident problems with mass media and magazines: there’s a lack of popular and independent, or popular and high-quality, or appealing to the younger generation. That’s why I’m confident — occupying the niche of leading next-generation media is not a problem.

### To Put it Simply

- Magazine — the face of the company. A popular magazine — the voice of the majority. A mega-popular magazine — sets the direction of development rather than adapting to bans or restrictions (there is a strategy)
- Producing quality films and games — a source of profit (there are scripts)
- The profit is reinvested into own IT technologies — even more profit (there are ideas)
- Win!
- Risks: in the worst case, we end up with just a popular magazine that earns through ads, with a donation system for investments and film/game production for sale to other companies. At the same time, the foundation remains solid, and growth is possible even under critical conditions

## Conclusion

Overall, my perspective is focused on large-scale development — creating a place separated from the state with its own independent ecosystem that combines various fields of activity: from innovative technologies to creative thinking. 

And if we gather the best in one place and organize a professional team of critical thinkers and enthusiasts, an evolutionary leap will happen naturally. 

Only minimal investments is needed to launch a mechanism that will eventually build a financially autonomous system with strong profit potential. Because nothing is impossible — only the wrong approach!
