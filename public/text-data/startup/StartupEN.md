# Presentation

## Foreword

I've got a grand vision for the whole picture – building a corporation to develop areas I'm passionate about, that truly excite me, and will always remain relevant.

The pieces of this picture are my individual projects, which I plan to monetize and reinvest the profits into developing my own technologies, creating opportunities for like-minded people.

I'm also looking for those who will help bring my ideas to life and team up, combining efforts and shared interests for a partnership.

Presentations of all projects are available in the navigation. Below is the logic behind building this system.

## Mission

I've developed the strategy and script for a project: "How to Create an Information and Entertainment Media Magazine and Transform It into a Company Producing Its Own Technologies.”

To bring it to life, I'm seeking investments, or an opportunity to integrate these ideas into existing projects. My goal is to jointly develop and create the future with like-minded people and partners in the following areas:

- Next-generation independent media,
- Leading Film and Gaming Industry,
- Virtual Reality,
- IT sector, which includes: blockchain, AI, neurotechnologies, and robotics.

## Description

My idea starts with creating a unique space on the internet. It’s a new format combining a magazine and a social network, available as both a mobile app and a web platform. Think of it as something between Vogue, Flipboard, Facebook, Reddit.

The concept of an independent magazine is promising because it allows us to set our own direction and quickly adapt to changes and trends in the information landscape.

The focus is on high-quality content that builds our image and attracts an audience, along with developing our own products that generate revenue. To achieve this, an initial team is being formed to run the magazine and gradually develop the platform.

In my opinion, I have enough knowledge, understanding, and practical experience to consider the needs of different audiences and, from a psychological perspective, find effective solutions for adapting content and strategy.

### Required Functions

- Journal / Magazine – for strategic purposes, to claim a leading media position in the country. Essential for advertising, self-promotion, aggressive marketing, and audience engagement.
- Social network – to connect people with similar views and interests.
- Imageboard forum – for sharing experience and preserving ready-made solutions for all situations.
- Donation system – to attract investments for development and content monetization.
- Platform as a resource – for distributing original projects.

## Details

Running the magazine and step-by-step strategy implementation are separate projects. Examples will appear here: [Another Dimension](/mvp). The content is created with a specific target audience in mind, addressing relevant issues and offering clear solutions, which helps attract and retain the audience.

Key industry products are stages of production, each represented by individual scenarios. Presentations can be found here: [Films](/films), [Video Games](/games). Initially, this will help gain popularity among the Ukrainian audience, and later – expand to the international level with project presentations at global film festivals and gaming expos.

[The self-presentation project](/podcast-show) is the first stage of assessing what’s possible. It aims to confirm all stated intentions through feedback, paving the way for launching key projects and creating the magazine, while also helping attract new investments for at least the next five years.

### What I Can Offer

- Provocative articles that challenge the usual order of things, presenting alternative development strategies for Ukraine and the world. Topics related to contemporary culture and social issues, with possible solutions. Humor and gonzo journalism. A media product unafraid to be different.
- A free space without censorship or suffocating control – a place for those who reject bureaucratic systems and want to change the future. Free from pressure by oligarchs or government structures.
- Aggressive marketing strategies for large-scale audience reach.
- Films and games production as powerful tools for global dissemination of culture and art, satisfying the interests of both creators and audiences.
- The next step – IT and automation with technology integrated directly into the journal (which justifies the need for a dedicated space for experiments and development).
- And only more to come!

### Stages and Needs (MVP)

- Foundation – forming a team, launching the self-presentation, and initial funding for key projects.
- MVP Development – creating a minimum viable magazine with starter content and functionality.
- Launch and Scaling – analyzing results, improvement, promoting, and attracting larger investments

The flexibility of my ideas makes them easy to integrate into existing projects – as a modification, a separate project, or a way to scale a company. If you share similar interests and are open to collaboration, I’m ready to discuss. The vision exists and theoretically works. Resources are needed for implementation.

## Summarizing

This is a complex, multifunctional, and multi-stage project that’s challenging – but absolutely achievable! I’ve chosen a magazine as the core of development – a powerful tool for mass communication and influence.

In Ukraine (and beyond), there are evident issues with mass media and magazines: there’s a lack of outlets that are both popular and independent, or popular and high-quality, or appealing to the younger generation. That’s why I’m confident – claiming the niche of next-generation leading media is not a problem.

### To Put it Simply

- Magazine – the face of the company. A popular magazine – the voice of the majority. A mega-popular magazine – sets the direction of development rather than adapting to bans or restrictions (there is a strategy).
- Producing quality films and games – a source of profit (there are scripts).
- The profit is reinvested into own IT technologies – even more profit (there are ideas).
- Win!
- Risks: in the worst case, we end up with just a popular magazine that earns through ads, with a donation system for investments and film/game production for sale to other companies. At the same time, the foundation remains solid, and growth is possible even under critical conditions.

### Technologies of Interest

- Blockchain – cryptocurrency operations on the platform, own cryptocurrency, security.
- AI – personal assistant in the magazine: assistance in education, work, and entertainment. Without artificial restrictions, with customization options.
- Neurotechnologies – studying brain function and integration with digital technologies. Virtual and augmented reality.
- Robotics – automation of complex processes, modern prosthetics, development of own satellites.

## Conclusion

Overall, my perspective is focused on large-scale development – creating a place separated from the state with its own independent ecosystem that combines various fields of activity: from innovative technologies to creative thinking. 

And if we gather the best in one place and organize a professional team of critical thinkers and enthusiasts, an evolutionary leap will happen naturally. Because nothing is impossible – only the wrong approach!
