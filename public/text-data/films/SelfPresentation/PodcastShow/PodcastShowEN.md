# Podcast Show: Dimension Minus Zero One Hundred and Forty-eight

***Format:** A mix between The Eric Andre Show and podcasts in the style of “let's pretend we know something and are fucking experts in these fields.”*

## Script

An improv-style show with pre-planned segments — quick chats with media personalities (or whoever we find).

The show features disguised self-interviews by the hosts, monologues, personal life stories, and other content. Guests are primarily needed for background, broader audience reach, and comedic situations.

There are two hosts — Main and Sidekick (female + male) + Background Character (maybe a few) + Guest.

The Main Host asks the main and any other questions (main ones are prepped in advance and needed to unpack key ideas).

All questions are directed at the guest, but the Sidekick keeps hijacking the conversation: answering questions themselves or interrupting the guest to add their take.

Both hosts must reveal the core idea in a bold, engaging way, not allowing the guest to develop their own. (If no guests show up — puppets / plush toys take their place and pretend to be celebrities.)

The Background Character is always present, doing their own thing, but steps in once a key question is covered — or just barges in randomly and interrupts everyone.

If a puppet is used as the guest, the Background Character plays the “inner thoughts” of that “celebrity” or argues about anything, joking that we’re so unpopular we couldn’t even book a hobo. (The Background Character’s actions must be fully improvised and unknown to the hosts).

## Background Character — Wildcard

Moves chaotically, changes costumes, dances, cooks, watches memes, laughs, stirs up chaos.

My vision of this character is shown in the slider videos (music, style, dancing).

Brings in short bursts of chaos between questions, destroying all textures in the background.

## Textures — Metaphor

Set design idea — abandoned building/factory styled like a post-Soviet apartment: carpets, wardrobes, outdated furniture, old TVs, kitchen bathrooms, etc. (For filming — possibly stress rooms.)

As the show progresses, the outdated gets destroyed and replaced.

The Background Character gradually dismantles the “Soviet” elements and brings in new ones — as a metaphor for breaking post-Soviet dependency, medieval thinking, fucking medievalism, and building a free world.

Another read: the Character is the past — a ghost of old Christmas — slowly becoming self-aware and wanting to evolve. He is our inner scream.

## Finale

The filming shifts to a studio with a clean, designer interior — as if we were there all along.

With the interior change, the Character transforms: new outfit, aristocratic posture, a pipe, etc.

It’s a literal evolution.

## Potential recurring show format

Three serious contemporary questions per episode — social, human, global. All seasoned with chaotic humor so we don’t go insane.

Texture ideas as metaphors tied to each theme. The Character “solves” the issue by destroying the old and inserting a new, healthier perspective.

## Consider Adding

- Killer soundtrack / background vinyl, gramophone, or giant radio (if broken but aesthetic — hide a speaker inside)
- Off-screen voice giving their two cents — like a live audience
- Hosts at an old table covered in newspaper: faceted glasses, vodka bottle, tea set, cookies, sandwiches — homestyle, like a "New Year table from the good old days"
- Baby lullaby and a toy child crying from time to time — we ignore it
- Come up with ”Easter eggs”
- If there’s no guest — make one up: Revo, port wine, a vibrator from a famous toxic personality, or a clone made from pigeon-delivered DNA
- Nearby: a sheet of plywood you can punch through screaming “KIYAAA,” or something similar. Acts as anti-stress like a gong / cue for next scene

## Script Ideas / Jokes

Danger Zone — unpredictably horrible humor.

- Intro: “This is the pilot epi... The pilot of a Broiler-747 passenger jet, currently going down for... (looks at watch that’s not there) ...539 seconds (the length of the show)...” then laughing — first at the host, then into one camera, then another
- “Podcast-show-Field-of-Miracles”, guest sector on the wheel! Reveal the guest! We open an ironic portrait on a stand and wheel it in
- Joke about banning stuff: “What is this — Nazi Germany?”
- Worst case — we just fuck around. Best case — two people will watch it
- Give me five years and Apple will personally call me asking: “Give us a ten,” and I’ll say: “Granny’s deaf, was it nine or ten?” … And give ‘em ten years in jail!
- If someone’s a nobody — label them absurdly: “Expert in sticks and shit,” “some guy from the hill,” “a fictional real person,” “beachside bum”
- Argument closer: “A guy from the hill — cause it sees the world better”
- “So you’re in IT?” — “Nah, IT people are like gods, I’m more of a high-functioning organism”

### Intro (or rework it for the ending):

Right before the greeting, we begin immediately with:

(calm, detached voice):

— Freakshow... fuck-ups... evolutionary leftovers... cracks on the nutsack of the collective unconscious... crusty textbook whores stuck in 2007…

(interrupts second host, same tone):

— Beating you to the punch, before your inevitable attempt to dump unresolved trauma on us instead of finally seeing a therapist and keeping your existential diarrhea out of the comments — we still say tha-a-a-aanks...

(a millisecond of silence. Then — sharp, emotional, powerful tone explosion):

— THAAAN FUCK YOOOU GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU LITTLE CUNT PUP! YOU DIRTY NAIL GUNK! A CONSTANTLY LEAKING TOILET TANK! A TWO-FOR-ONE HEMORRHOID! A UNUSED LIFE COUPON! PUSSY! VIRGIN...!

(grand pause. Return to calm tone):

— We love you. Like your parents never did.

— ‘Cause that’s how real trust is built. Through pain, screams, and a faint whiff of hangover breath.

(gentle segue into the show’s start):

— Well, let’s fucking go.

— Welcome to the show. Nobody invited you, but now that you’re here — enjoy.
