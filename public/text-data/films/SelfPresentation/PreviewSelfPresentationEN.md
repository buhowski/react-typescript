# Self-presentation Projects

## Preface

Here are ideas possible without any funding, but impossible without initiative people potentially willing to get involved.

This is the foundation for a start — those are needed who want to dive into the unknown of the final result, but for the experience and for something like “messing around for fun.”

If you are just planning to become a content creator, or already one but lack ideas, or just want to try something new — all these projects, if we make them, you can use only on your own channels.

There’s no advertising here — the shows are presented purely for entertainment, while lightly touching on broader, more significant themes.
