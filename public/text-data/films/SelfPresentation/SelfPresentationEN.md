# Self-presentation Projects

Here are ideas that are possible without funding but are impossible without proactive people ready to get involved.

The foundation for starting is people willing to dive into the unknown of the final result, but for the experience and the desire to have fun.

If you are just planning to get into content creation or are already involved but lack ideas or want to try something new â€” all these projects, if we implement them, can be used exclusively on your own channels.
