#### Creative Experiments / Shows

# Self-presentation Projects

Here are ideas that are possible without any funding, but impossible without initiative-driven people potentially willing to get involved.

This is the basis for a kick-off — need those who want to dive into the unknown of the final result, but for the experience and for something akin to ”messing around for fun.”

If you're just planning to get into content creation, or are already there but lack ideas, or simply want to try something new — all these projects, if we make them, you can use solely on your own channels.

There's no advertising here — the shows are presented purely in an entertainment format, superficially touching upon large key ideas.
