# The Corp .!.

## Main Idea

This is a pseudo-documentary backstage series that showcases the real process of building a corporation from scratch, enhanced with improvised performances.

It's our satirical take on modern corporations: about "fascism in the details," "individual galleys and rowers", "talent meat grinder", about the so-called "family atmosphere" and the senseless waste of resources. In the series, we'll highlight what we believe work should truly be like, but with boundless self-irony.

This is raw reality mixed with the absurdity we intentionally add to the workflow to create a lively and engaging series. We openly show everything we do — it's both self-promotion and a powerful driver for our development. However, the story isn't about business or complex processes. It's about people surviving in an office where the main drama isn't the work itself, but everything that's done instead of it.

It's very similar to the American "The Office," but this project doesn't copy the original. We create scenes in a real workspace, adapting realities to flexible humor, absurdity, and specific characters.
