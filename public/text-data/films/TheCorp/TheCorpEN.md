# The Corp .!.

[mobile-slider]

## Core Idea

A pseudo-documentary backstage series about the real process of building a corporation from scratch — showing everything we face while creating this corporation. It’s raw reality mixed with absurdity that we add to the workflow to create a lively, ironic show.

We openly show everything we do — it’s both self-promotion and a way to move forward. But this series is not about business or complicated processes — it’s about people surviving in an office where the main drama isn’t work, but everything happening instead of it.

A very close analogy to the American “The Office,” but our version doesn’t copy the original — it creates scenes in a real work environment and adapts reality with absurdity, flexible humor, and unique characters.
