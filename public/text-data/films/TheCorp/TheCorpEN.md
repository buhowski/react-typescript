#### Reality-Based Mockumentary Series

# The Corp .!.

## Logline

A mockumentary-style behind-the-scenes series about building your own corporation. A lively, ironic nod to the American "The Office", blending real workspace scenes with absurdity and scripted moments that deliberately disrupt the workflow.

## Main Idea

This format shows the real process of starting a corporation from scratch, mixed with improvised setups.

It’s our satirical take on modern corporate culture: the "fascism in the details", the "galleys and rowers", the "talent grinder", the fake "family atmosphere", and the senseless waste of resources. We highlight what work shouldn’t be — with boundless self-irony.

It’s raw reality mixed with absurdity that we intentionally insert into the work process to create a vibrant, absurd, and engaging series. We openly show everything we do — it’s both self-promotion and a driving force for our growth.

But the story isn’t about business or processes. It’s about people trying to survive in an office where the main drama isn’t the job itself, but everything that happens instead of it.

Like "The Office", we film in a real workspace — but we don’t copy the original. We create our own scenes, shaped by flexible humor, absurdity, and distinctive characters.
