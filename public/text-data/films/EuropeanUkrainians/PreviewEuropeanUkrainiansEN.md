# European Ukrainians

A dark-humored sitcom about a group of young "idiots" who, facing the absurdity of the Ukrainian "Europe" environment, challenge lifeâ€™s realities on the path of self-development, maintaining a delicate balance between optimism, a fuck-it attitude, and uncontrollably fatal hysteria in the unfolding events.
