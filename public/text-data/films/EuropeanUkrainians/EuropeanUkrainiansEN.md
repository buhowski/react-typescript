# European Ukrainians

***Format:** Sitcom with elements of dark humor for streaming platforms*

***Duration:** 20-40 minutes episode*

***Audience:** Teens, Adults*

## Main Idea

This is a story about a group of young idiots who challenge the absurd realities of life on their path to self-development. The narrative unfolds through sarcastic-satirical and self-deprecating mockery, directed both at the system and the people within it.

This is how the characters perceive the surrounding world to keep from losing their minds. Thanks to their friendship (which is actually egoistic and immoral) and support (where they betray and ditch each other), they still stick together and try to find their place in society, constantly stumbling into awkward situations.

These strangers meet under certain circumstances. The situation leads them to a lasting friendship — through pain, screaming, and a faint smell of booze, because that's the only way "true love" is born.

## Overview

The series concept is a fun mix, inspired by projects like [Trailer Park Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988/), [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/), [Broad City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2578560/), and [New Kids Turbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648112/).

The videos in the slider demonstrate typical scenes where characters find themselves in awkward, comical, or absurd situations, often leading to shouting, panic, or a complete breakdown of the situation.

It's precisely these elements — a similar style of presentation, the temperaments of the characters, a dynamic style of comical situations, and unpredictability of events — that I aim to adapt to Ukrainian realities and the context of the "Euro-Soviet" era. Most importantly, it's about the feeling of authenticity, so that the characters portray themselves or someone deeply akin to them.

The series concept uses humor and satire to sharply, ironically, and yet insightfully reflect the shortcomings and achievements of Ukraine on its path to European integration.

It will also showcase the stereotypes and cultural specifics of each European country through the prism of Ukrainian reality.

The reality of Ukrainian life unfolds before the viewer — from the depths of the countryside to the pulsating heart of the capital. This is a series for people who aren't afraid to laugh at problems, but also want their voices to be heard.

### Script

- Topical issues relevant to everyone
- The main characters are ordinary people from different generations, constantly accompanied by a money deficit, but who are desperately trying to find their way in the world of work and relationships
- Each episode is a new adventure from the main characters' lives, where they face various societal problems and challenges like corruption, lack of culture, gender inequality, outdated views, violence, addictions, unemployment, and so on
- Egocentric, hysterical, and anxious views and judgments often lead the characters into trouble, creating a multitude of awkward situations that usually only get worse before they get better
- To show reality without censorship, with heartfelt humor.
- It's important for the series to be genuine
- It should encourage people to reflect on the problems of Ukrainian society, shedding light on painful topics through humor

## Character examples

Here are some quick conceptual outlines. In my vision, characters should be skilled at improvisation and capable of engaging in "Tarantino-style" dialogues, filled with unpredictable absurdity and unexpected plot twists.

### Male Character 01

- Fond of alcohol, always carries a thermos (or a glass or goblet) with self-made cocktails
- Knows how to control himself and not lose control of the situation
- Kind, stylish, positive, with a writer's mindset and good use of swearing
- Master of dude quotes and silly toasts (sarcasm and self-irony)
- Favorite drink: port wine

### Male Character 02

- Fond of smoking marijuana, well-read, interested in science fiction and psychology
- Often "spaces out" or loses touch with reality, vividly imagining the development of events (example: the last video in the slider)

### Male Character 03

- Tries to lead a healthy lifestyle without bad habits, but understands that there is no healthy lifestyle — only common sense
- Enjoys sports, non-stereotypical
- Treats everything with understanding and does not judge
- Strong character and self-control

### Female Character 01

- Energetic, optimistic-emotional, creative personality, loves art
- Has a sharp tongue and enjoys dark humor, often jokes inappropriately
- Just one step from marginality to aestheticism

### Female Character 02

- Calm, thoughtful, with a diplomatic mindset, strategist
- Knows how to find common ground with people, although she hates them in general
- Pulls off skating around in a business suit and heels like it's nothing

### Wildcard Character (age 55+)

- Cunning, cynical, with a sharp mind and sarcastic sense of humor, orator
- Has rich life experience
- Knows how to find a way out of any situation, but "too old for this shit"
- Values freedom and independence, a lone wolf, but works in a team when necessary

## Conclusion

I believe that with a new approach to implementation and a more professional attitude to the emotional transmission of the picture, "European Ukrainians" will become a successful project and a calling card on the world television market, attracting investments for the development of future ideas. There’s an endless stream of ideas and plenty to work with — but resources are essential.

So I’m asking for your support to help bring this unique project to life. It will shift your perspective on modern Ukrainian life and prove just how much potential is hidden behind the barriers of the system.
