## Overview

The concept of the series is a hilarious mix inspired by shows like “Trailer Park Boys” ([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988/)), "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" (examples 01 – 03 in slider, or [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/)), "Broad City" (example 04 in slider, or [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2578560/)), and the "New Kids Turbo" movie (example 05 in slider, or [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648112/)). 

The videos are provided for better understanding. I want to use it in a Ukrainian way, a close similar style of presentation, character temperaments, dynamic style of comedic situations, and unpredictability of events. The main focus is on authenticity, allowing the main characters to play themselves or characters close to their spirits.

The idea of the series uses humor and satire to sharply, ironically, and at the same time insightfully reflect the shortcomings and achievements of Ukraine on the path to European integration. It will also showcase stereotypes and cultural peculiarities of each European country through the prism of Ukrainian reality. 

The viewer will discover the reality of Ukrainian life – from the depths of the countryside to the pulsating heart of the capital. This is a series for people who are not afraid to laugh at problems, but at the same time want their voices to be heard.

### Plot

- Topical issues that are close to the young audience.
- The main characters are ordinary people of different generations who are constantly struggling with financial difficulties, but who are trying their best to find their way in the world of work and relationships.
- Each episode is a new adventure in the lives of the main characters, in which they face various problems and challenges of society, such as corruption, lack of culture, gender inequality, outdated views, violence, addiction, unemployment, and so on.
- The characters' egocentric, hysterical, and anxious views and judgments often lead them into trouble, creating a myriad of uncomfortable situations that usually only get worse before they get better.
- The goal is to show reality without censorship, with soulful, and sometimes black humor.
- Important for the series to be sincere.
- It should encourage people to reflect on the problems of Ukrainian society, highlighting painful topics through humor.

## Conclusion

I believe that with a new approach to implementation and a more professional attitude to the emotional transmission of the picture, "European Ukrainians" will become a successful project and a calling card on the world television market, attracting investments for the development of future ideas. There are an endless number of ideas and a lot to work with, but resources are needed.

Therefore, I ask you to support this unique project, which will change your view of modern Ukrainian life and prove how much potential is hidden behind the barriers of the system.
