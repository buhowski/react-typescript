# European Ukrainians

***Format:** Sarcastic-ironic sitcom for streaming platforms*

***Duration:** 20-40 minutes episode*

***Audience:** Teens, Adults*

## Core Idea

A sarcastic and satirical mockery, laced with dark humor, aimed at the system and the people trapped within it. This is a story about a group of young idiots who challenge the absurd realities of life on their path to self-growth. 

With self-irony and dark humor, they face the world around them to avoid losing their minds. Thanks to a friendship that’s actually selfish and immoral, and support where they often screw each other over, they still stick together and try to find their place in society, constantly getting into ridiculous situations.

Strangers meet under certain circumstances. The situation brings them to a lasting friendship — through pain, screams, and a faint smell of booze, because that’s the only way “true love” is born.

## Overview

The concept of the series is a fun mix, inspired by projects like [Trailer Park Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988/), [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/), [Broad City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2578560/), and [New Kids Turbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648112/).

The videos in the slider demonstrate typical scenes where characters find themselves in an awkward, comical, or absurd predicament, often leading to screaming, panic, or a complete meltdown of the situation. 

It's precisely these elements — a similar manner of presentation, the temperaments of the characters, a dynamic style of comical situations, and unpredictability of events — that I aim to adapt to Ukrainian realities and the Eurosoviet context. The most important thing is the sense of authenticity, so the characters portray themselves, or someone genuinely close to their spirit.

The idea of the series uses humor and satire to sharply, ironically, and at the same time insightfully reflect the shortcomings and achievements of Ukraine on the path to European integration. It will also showcase stereotypes and cultural peculiarities of each European country through the prism of Ukrainian reality.

The viewer will discover the reality of Ukrainian life — from the depths of the countryside to the pulsating heart of the capital. This is a series for people who are not afraid to laugh at problems, but at the same time want their voices to be heard.

### Script

- Topical issues that are close to everyone
- The main characters are ordinary people of different generations who are constantly struggling with financial difficulties, but who are trying their best to find their way in the world of work and relationships
- Each episode is a new adventure in the lives of the main characters, in which they face various problems and challenges of society, such as corruption, lack of culture, gender inequality, outdated views, violence, addiction, unemployment, and so on
- The characters' egocentric, hysterical, and anxious views and judgments often lead them into trouble, creating a myriad of uncomfortable situations that usually only get worse before they get better
- The goal is to show reality without censorship, with soulful, and sometimes black humor
- Important for the series to be sincere
- It should encourage people to reflect on the problems of Ukrainian society, highlighting painful topics through humor

## Character examples

Here are quick idea sketches. Basically, in my vision, the characters should be able to improvise and carry “Tarantino-style” dialogues with unpredictable absurdity and unexpected plot twists.

### Male Character 01

- Fond of alcohol, always carries a thermos (or a glass or goblet) with self-made cocktails
- Knows how to control himself and not lose control of the situation
- Kind, stylish, positive, with a writer's mindset and good use of swearing
- Master of dude quotes and silly toasts (sarcasm and self-irony)
- Favorite drink: port wine

### Male Character 02

- Fond of smoking marijuana, well-read, interested in science fiction and psychology
- Often "spaces out" or loses touch with reality, vividly imagining the development of events (example: the last video in the slider)

### Male Character 03

- Tries to lead a healthy lifestyle without bad habits, but understands that there is no healthy lifestyle — only common sense
- Enjoys sports, non-stereotypical
- Treats everything with understanding and does not judge
- Strong character and self-control

### Female Character 01

- Energetic, optimistic-emotional, creative personality, loves art
- Has a sharp tongue and enjoys dark humor, often jokes inappropriately
- Just one step from marginality to aestheticism

### Female Character 02

- Calm, thoughtful, with a diplomatic mindset, strategist
- Knows how to find common ground with people, although she hates them in general
- Pulls off skating around in a business suit and heels like it's nothing

### Wildcard Character (age 55+)

- Cunning, cynical, with a sharp mind and sarcastic sense of humor, orator
- Has rich life experience
- Knows how to find a way out of any situation, but "too old for this shit"
- Values freedom and independence, a lone wolf, but works in a team when necessary

## Conclusion

I believe that with a new approach to implementation and a more professional attitude to the emotional transmission of the picture, "European Ukrainians" will become a successful project and a calling card on the world television market, attracting investments for the development of future ideas. There’s an endless stream of ideas and plenty to work with — but resources are essential.

So I’m asking for your support to help bring this unique project to life. It will shift your perspective on modern Ukrainian life and prove just how much potential is hidden behind the barriers of the system.
