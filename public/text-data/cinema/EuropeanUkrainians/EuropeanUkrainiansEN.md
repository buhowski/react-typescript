#### Dark Comedy / Series

# European Ukrainians

## Logline

A dark humor sitcom about a group of young idiots who, amid the absurdity of Ukrainian Europe, challenge life's realities on the path to self-development. They balance between optimism, carelessness, and uncontrollable hysterics, which leads to fatal consequences.

## Main Idea

The narrative unfolds through the prism of satire and self-ironic mockery of both the system and the people within it. This is the only way the characters perceive the surrounding world, in order not to go crazy.

Thanks to a friendship that is in fact selfish and immoral, and support where they set each other up and abandon each other, the characters still stick together, trying to find their place in society and constantly getting into awkward situations.

Completely different strangers meet under circumstances that bring them closer — through pain, screaming, and the faint smell of booze, because that's the only way true love is born.

This is a series that uses humor and satire to sharply and ironically reflect Ukraine's shortcomings and achievements on its path to European integration (although this integration brings nothing but idiocy), as well as to show the stereotypes and cultural features of European countries.

### Description

The concept of the series is a fun mix, inspired by projects such as [Trailer Park Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988/), [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/), [Broad City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2578560/), and [New Kids Turbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648112/).

Videos in the slider demonstrate typical scenes where the characters find themselves in an awkward, comical, or absurd position, which often leads to screaming, panic, or a complete collapse of the situation.

It is precisely these elements — a similar manner of delivery, the temperaments of the characters, the dynamic style of comical situations, and the unpredictability of events — that I strive to adapt to Ukrainian realities and the context of Euro-Soviet. The most important thing is the feeling of authenticity, so that the characters play themselves or those close to them in spirit.

### Themes

- Everyday problems familiar to everyone: money, work, relationships, finding oneself
- Characters of different generations, each with their own style of survival in the chaos of society
- In each episode, there is a new adventure that drives the characters into a dead end: from corruption and gender inequality to dependencies and absurd manifestations of a lack of culture
- The egocentrism and anxiety of the characters create comical situations that usually only get more complicated before a resolution is found
- Without censorship, with irony and warm black humor, the series reflects reality as it is
- The show's task is not only to entertain but also to prompt reflection on the problems of Ukrainian society
- The reality of Ukrainian life unfolds before the viewer — from the depths of the countryside to the pulsating heart of the capital. This is a series for people who are not afraid to laugh at problems, but at the same time want their voices to be heard

## Character Examples

Here are quick conceptual sketches. In my vision, the characters should possess a mastery of improvisation and conduct Tarantino-esque dialogues, full of unpredictable absurdity and unexpected twists.

### Male Character 01

- Loves alcohol, constantly carries a thermos mug (or a glass or a goblet), sipping on self-made cocktails
- Generally knows how to keep himself in check and not lose control of the situation
- Kind, stylish, positive, and with appropriate use of swearing
- A master of bro-quotes and stupid toasts (sarcasm and self-irony)
- Favorite drink — port wine

### Male Character 02

- Loves smoking marijuana, well-read, interested in science fiction and psychology
- Often messes up or flies out of reality, vividly imagining the course of events (example: the last video in the slider)

### Male Character 03

- Tries to lead a healthy lifestyle without bad habits, but understands that a healthy lifestyle doesn't exist — only common sense
- Loves playing sports, not stereotypical
- Treats everything with understanding and without judgment
- Strong character and self-control

### Female Character 01

- Energetic, optimistically emotional, creative in character, loves art
- Has a sharp tongue and loves black humor, often jokes inappropriately
- From marginality to an aesthete — one step

### Female Character 02

- Calm, reasonable, with a diplomatic mindset, a strategist
- Knows how to find common ground with people, although she generally hates them
- Can afford to ride a skateboard in a business suit and heels

### Wildcard Character (age 55+)

- Cunning, cynical, with a sharp mind and a sarcastic sense of humor, an orator
- Has rich life experience
- Knows how to find a way out of any situation, but is too old for this kind of shit
- Values freedom and independence, a lone wolf, but if necessary, works in a team
