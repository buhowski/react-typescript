# Volyn Wedding: The Groom's Room

## Logline

The story of a wedding everyone wanted except for the couple themselves, and the night before the ceremony that turns into a surreal quest involving a kidnapping, corrupt border guards, and a Roma-Polish-Belarusian drug cartel.

## Main Idea

This is a feature-length comedy-drama with elements of black satire and absurdity, set in modern-day Volyn. The story follows two semi-successful natives of the Ukrainian provinces who return home to celebrate their wedding according to classic traditions. Although the couple has long moved past these archaic customs, they still agree to the wedding for the sake of their families, because sometimes old traditions are stronger than common sense.

The main characters are the bride and groom, along with their friends: the groom's best man, the maid of honor, and a "plus-one" for each of them. A separate intrigue exists between these two couples that unfolds throughout the story. The best man and the maid of honor have yet to meet, but their personalities are similar: both are myopic, impulsive, and hysterical, yet at the same time kind and sweet. This forces them to constantly bicker, both with each other and together against everyone else. Their "plus-ones" are the complete opposite of their partners, and they begin to flirt with each other behind their friends' backs.

### Plot

Everything begins in the city, where the characters are bustling around, handling the last-minute tasks before their departure to Holy Volyn—the wedding venue. Phone conversations reveal the backstory: the proposal has been made, and the wedding has been approved by their relatives. Meanwhile, the groom’s best man is constantly trying to get ordained online for the wedding. Although he is an atheist, he's convinced that baptizing friends is almost the same as marrying them, which means he can perform the ceremony himself.

Everyone travels to the wedding venue in separate cars, meeting up there. Later, on the evening before the wedding, bachelor and bachelorette parties kick off, blending city and local traditions. It's decided they'll split up: the men go to their party, and the women go to theirs.

In true classic fashion, the men's evening spins out of control: a first toast, "boom," a dark screen. The men wake up in cages in a strange place, their peace broken by a mix of Polish, Belarusian, and Romani languages, which instantly sobers them up but leaves them in a state of shocking confusion.

A flashback takes us to the bachelorette party: the girls, along with some local girlfriends, decide to visit a disco club. There, they expertly shut down the local thugs with a direct punch to the throat. They get bored and decide to find the guys to stir up some chaos.

They find out the men have disappeared and start their own comedic-detective investigation, turning their late-night drive through villages and fields into a drunken quest. All clues lead them to some Roma drug camp at the triple border of Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus, where even the border guards are involved.

The girls develop a plan for liberation in the style of "Charlie's Angels" and break into the camp. Of course, everything goes off-plan, turning into total improvisation and chaos. In the commotion, they find and free the guys. Thanks to their "perfect" plan, everything accidentally catches fire, causing a domino effect. The characters escape like in a classic action movie, with explosions and flames behind them, covered in mud, beaten up, but alive—at least physically.

Barely fitting into the car, the characters, shocked and fucked up from what happened, drive to the wedding in silence. The radio plays some Polish-Belarusian music, which enhances the atmosphere of booze breath and a beautiful sunrise on the road. They stop at a gas station, where, hungry, they greedily eat while nodding their heads to the same strange music, processing all the thrilling events.

In the finale, beaten up but dressed, they arrive at the wedding. Everything goes well; everyone is happy. At the end, when everyone gathers together, the maid of honor's "plus-one" says, "Turns out I was recording everything on video. Want to see? It's a fucking mess..." This is followed by scenes showing how they got into these drug-fueled misadventures, similar to the ending of the film The Hangover.
