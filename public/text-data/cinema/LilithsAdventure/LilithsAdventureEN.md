## Main Idea

This animated comedy series tells the story of a sarcastic, sharp-tongued adventurer. Her travels through endless worlds became possible thanks to a unique artifact — a traveler's journal.

Her very first journey turned into a trap: due to carelessness, she permanently lost access to her home dimension. Now, lost in the unknown, the heroine tries to unravel the journal's secrets to find her way home. However, her impulsiveness and adventurous nature constantly lead her into new, even more dangerous escapades.

The key to Lilith's return to her home world is an artifact being toyed with by the one who calls himself the Supreme Architect. His game is merely part of a much larger conflict, as numerous artifacts, imbued with unique power, are scattered throughout the multiverse.

### Plot

The story begins with the heroine wandering through wondrous worlds. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and her present is a constant series of adventures, escapes from trouble, and skillful verbal manipulations that help her extract any information.

Later, her travels gain a new purpose when she notices strange distortions in time and space — barely perceptible anomalies that indicate someone's interference. Intrigued but wary, she turns her adventures into a genuine investigation.

With each new adventure, details of her past will gradually be revealed: the circumstances under which she found the journal, how she fell into the trap, and what actually happened to her home world and loved ones.

### Antagonists

The Supreme Architect is an artist and a creative soul, a master of manipulation, fascinated by ancient scriptures and the secrets of controlling gods. He toys with a powerful artifact that governs realities, creating his own game, which he himself doesn't fully comprehend yet.

His artifact is the key to multiversal synchronicity, allowing him to influence reality everywhere and simultaneously. To him, worlds are like vast canvases where he paints, alters, or erases whatever displeases him. His colossal ego and penchant for eccentric antics threaten to break reality. He signs his creations: "Even gods get bored sometimes".

His image combines the aesthetics of the Artist from the game [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/), whose paintings transform into traps and labyrinths of worlds, and the concept of the architect-narrator from the animated series [Rick and Morty, S4E6](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10655686/), who constructs the plots of the universe.

However, the most dangerous threat comes from the mysterious Collector, who seeks to gather all the artifacts into one. Those who dare to resist, or simply become an interesting exhibit for his collection, are turned into a terrifying display of living toys, imprisoned within the transparent walls of a giant Terrarium of Worlds.

### The Diary's Mechanics

Portals between realities are created using the traveler's journal. By writing down a desired destination, a corridor opens between worlds or moments in time, which exists as long as the page with the entry is not destroyed.

While a portal is active, it's impossible to open another one. Any interference in another world does not affect the base reality, and attempts to change the past only create separate parallel branches.

After a passage is closed, it's impossible to open a new portal to the exact same reality. One can only enter a random version, as in this theory, time is movement and speed, so it's impossible to return to the same point twice.

The journal contains instructions, and its name and logo feature a small penguin nibbling on apples and discarding them. With each piece, new parallel worlds are born.

## Series Structure: Season Arcs

The series' story unfolds through sequential arcs, where each stage becomes a step towards the decisive confrontation…

or towards the endless and merciless dry-milking of the genre.

### Season 2

Having ended up in the Terrarium of Worlds, the heroine and the Architect are forced to join forces to survive. Within this closed ecosystem, another, more human side of the Architect is revealed, and they become allies. The season's climax is their epic escape and the destruction of the glass walls, freeing the entire collection.

### Season 3

On the loose, the heroine and the Architect begin a focused fight against the Collector. They unravel the secrets of the artifacts and seek key knowledge to confront the main antagonist and exact revenge.

### Season 4 and beyond

The plot transforms into a continuous chase, full of new challenges. The heroes encounter strange worlds, unusual characters, and powerful artifacts on their path to a decisive battle with the Collector.
