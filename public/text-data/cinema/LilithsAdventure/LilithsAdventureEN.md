## Main Idea

This animated comedy series follows a sarcastic adventurer with a sharp wit. Her travels through endless worlds were made possible by a unique artifact: a traveler’s diary.

Her very first journey became a trap: due to carelessness, she lost access to her home dimension forever. Now, lost in the unknown, the heroine tries to unravel the diary's mysteries to find her way home. However, her impulsiveness and adventurous nature lead her into new, even more dangerous escapades.

The key to her world is an artifact with which a being calling himself the Supreme Architect entertains himself. His game is only a part of a much larger conflict, as numerous artifacts with unique power are scattered throughout the multiverse.

### Plot

The story begins with the heroine wandering through wondrous worlds. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and her present is a series of constant adventures, escapes from trouble, and skillful verbal manipulations that help her extract any information.

Over time, her travels take on a new meaning when she notices strange distortions of time and space — barely noticeable anomalies that indicate someone's external interference. Intrigued yet wary, she turns her adventures into a real investigation.

### Antagonists

The Supreme Architect is an artist and creative spirit, a master manipulator fascinated by ancient writings and the secrets of controlling gods. He toys with a powerful artifact that governs realities, crafting his own game, which he himself doesn't fully comprehend.

His artifact is the key to multiversal synchronicity, allowing him to be present and influence reality everywhere, simultaneously. To him, worlds are like vast canvases where he paints, alters, or erases anything he dislikes. His immense ego and penchant for eccentric antics threaten to break reality. He signs his creations: "Even gods get bored sometimes."

His image blends the aesthetics of the Artist from the game [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/), whose paintings become traps and labyrinths of worlds, with the concept of a narrator-architect from the animated series [Rick and Morty — Never Ricking Morty, S4E6](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10655686/), who constructs the universe's plots.

However, the most dangerous threat is the mysterious Collector, who seeks to gather all artifacts into one. Those who dare to resist or simply become an interesting exhibit for his collection, he turns into a macabre display of living toys, imprisoned within the transparent walls of the colossal Terrarium of Worlds.

### The Diary's Mechanics

Portals between realities are created using the traveler's diary. After writing down a desired destination, a corridor opens between worlds or moments in time, existing as long as the page with the entry is not destroyed.

While a portal is active, opening another is impossible. Any changes made between worlds do not affect the base reality, and attempts to interfere with the flow of time create only a separate parallel branch.

After closing a passage, it's impossible to open a new portal to the exact same temporal reality. One can only enter a random version, like grasping at straws. In this theory, time is movement and speed, thus it's impossible to return to the same point twice.

The diary contains instructions, and its name and logo feature a small penguin nibbling on apples and discarding them. With each discarded piece, new parallel worlds are born.

## Series Structure: Season Arcs

The series' story unfolds through sequential arcs, with each stage being a step towards a decisive confrontation… or towards an endless and ruthless dry-milking of the genre.

### Season 1

The heroine is engrossed in her adventures, investigating temporal anomalies that eventually lead her to the Supreme Architect. The season finale brings an unexpected twist: both characters—the heroine and the Architect—find themselves trapped by the mysterious Collector.

### Season 2

Trapped within the Terrarium of Worlds, the heroine and the Architect are forced to join forces to survive. Within this closed ecosystem, a different, more human side of the Architect is revealed, and they become allies. The season's climax is their epic escape and the destruction of the glass walls, which frees the entire collection.

### Season 3

Free, the heroine and the Architect embark on a focused fight against the Collector. They unravel the secrets of the artifacts and seek key knowledge to confront the main antagonist and exact revenge.

### Season 4 and beyond

The plot evolves into a continuous chase, full of new challenges. The heroes face strange worlds, unusual characters, and powerful artifacts on their path to a decisive battle with the Collector.

## Inspiration

- Rick and Morty, S7E5 (scene from the slider) — the drama of a traveler in eternal pursuit, exploring different dimensions
- [Alice in Wonderland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014759/) — surreal, absurd worlds, and curiosity that leads to a captivating journey
- [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/) — antagonist motives and intrigues
- [Solar Opposites, S4: The Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0a85gwgQ8A) — the concept of the Collector antagonist and the Terrarium of Worlds
- [Fallout](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12637874/), [Westworld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/) — atmosphere and the search for truth
- Animation Style — a blend of Rick and Morty's energy and humor with the detail, urban noir, and design of Nier: [Replicant](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113560/NieR_Replicant_ver122474487139/) / [Automata](https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/)
- [High On Life](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583230/High_On_Life/) — this game demonstrates how black humor, sarcastic dialogues, and genre-parody from animated projects can work in a video game format. This is precisely why a game based on this series could be created
