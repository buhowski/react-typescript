#### Dark Crime Comedy / Animated Movie

# Wooden Fiction

## Logline

A dark comedy where beloved fairy tale characters get caught up in criminal showdowns, and their brutal, absurd adventures are woven into a single, non-linear narrative full of unexpected twists and black humor.

## Main Idea

A satirical crime anthology that blends a non-linear narrative and iconic dialogues in the style of Tarantino with harsh humor and the grotesque aesthetic of post-Soviet reality. This is a project where absurdity becomes the norm.

The plot unfolds in a grim yet recognizable world, inhabited by re-imagined characters from Ukrainian and Soviet children’s fairy tales. Familiar heroes transform into tangled, morally ambiguous figures involved in criminal schemes and dirty dealings.

The story is comprised of several intertwined narratives, each developing separately but ultimately converging into a single plot that pieces all the puzzles together. The viewer travels between timelines, watching how the characters' random events and decisions impact each other's destinies.

Behind the chaotic plot and black humor lies a harsh satire. The animated film ridicules ideals and narratives that have become distorted over time and exposes the corruption of naive archetypes. It is a story where a fairy tale becomes a reflection of brutal reality.

## Inspiration

- [Pulp Fiction, 1994](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/) — non-linear narrative, stylish dialogues, and black humor.
- [Mikhail Elizarov:](https://neolurk.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB_%D0%95%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2) Burattini. Fascism Passed — a harsh, absurd satire on the Soviet legacy.
