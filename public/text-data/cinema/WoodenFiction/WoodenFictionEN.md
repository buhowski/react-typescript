## Logline

A dark comedy where familiar characters from children's fairy tales become participants in criminal showdowns. Their brutal and absurd adventures are woven into a non-linear narrative, full of unexpected twists and black humor.

## Main Idea

This is a satirical crime anthology that combines a non-linear narrative and sharp dialogue in the style of Tarantino with harsh humor and the grotesque aesthetic of post-Soviet reality, where absurdity becomes the norm.

The plot unfolds in a grim yet recognizable world, inhabited by reinterpreted characters from Ukrainian and Soviet fairy tales. Familiar heroes are transformed into confused, morally ambiguous characters involved in criminal schemes.

The narrative consists of several intertwined stories, each developing separately but eventually converging into a single plot. The viewer travels between timelines, observing how random events and the characters' decisions affect each other's destinies.

Behind the chaotic plot and black humor hides a harsh satire. The film ridicules ideals and narratives that have become distorted over time and shows how corruption destroys even the purest images. It's a story where a fairy tale becomes a reflection of a brutal reality.

## Inspiration

- [Pulp Fiction, 1994](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/) — non-linear narrative, stylish dialogues, and black humor
- [Mikhail Elizarov:](https://neolurk.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB_%D0%95%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2) Burattini. Fascism Passed — a harsh, absurd satire on the Soviet legacy
