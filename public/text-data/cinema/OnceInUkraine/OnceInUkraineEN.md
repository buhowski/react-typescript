## Main Idea

This is a feature-length social drama with a mix of black satire and tragic irony. The action takes place in a typical Soviet-style Ukrainian neighborhood, with its monotonous five-story buildings and high-rises, faceless courtyards, shabby entrances, the rumble of minibuses, the clamor of the market, and the cold of the supermarket. The time is the present, living in the shadow of war.

The film is structured as a mosaic of human destinies. The camera moves from one home to another, peering into windows: a young family that has just moved in; single mothers with different fates; old people living out their lives; teenagers rebelling against their parents; students and workers exhausted by the gray routine; local alcoholics and homeless people who are slowly fading away. They are almost strangers, only occasionally crossing paths in the courtyard, in a queue, or in the stairwell.

A special focus is placed on an apartment in the building across the street, where a young dreamer lives with his girlfriend. He smokes roll-ups, washes them down with morning alcohol, and loves to listen to music — all in an attempt to escape reality into his own fantasies.

We see scenes that depict everyday life: from boring school lessons to a difficult, hot workday. In the very first frames, we see the main character in a supermarket, as well as a pushy, entitled mother who bullies her way through the queue. This small scene immediately brings him back to the mundane reality he's so desperately trying to escape.

Thus, step by step, a single picture is formed — a setting familiar to everyone. The scenes intertwine, sometimes causing laughter, sometimes cutting to the quick, highlighting poignant issues to lead the viewer to the finale.

### Finale

As evening falls, an air raid siren sounds. In the apartments, their own micro-worlds exist: family arguments drown out the sirens, some, ignoring the danger, turn on their favorite TV show, while others frantically gather their belongings for the bomb shelter. Different reactions, different fates intersecting in a single moment.

In the building across the street, the main character, with headphones on, smokes and stares into the sky, watching the last rays of the sun disappear. His girlfriend says something, but he can’t hear. She puts out her cigarette, puts on her headphones too, and silently takes his hand. They meet each other’s gaze, nod, kiss, and walk over to a table with alcohol and two equal portions of pills.

At that moment, a rocket hits the building across the street, leveling it to the ground. They don’t hear the explosion, but the vibration shakes the building they are in. They look out the window and see true hell — flames and chaos engulfing the neighboring house. They smile sadly with tears in their eyes, unhurriedly return to the table, swallow the pills, wash them down with alcohol, sit by the window, and light up cigarettes.

He remembers: "Because you won't get into heaven by suicide". They take each other’s hands and cut their wrists lengthwise. In the headphones, Pixies — Where Is My Mind? plays (or something similar).

The camera moves out of their window and slowly pulls away as the song plays in the background. First, it shows the chaos and fire. Then — other buildings, other apartments: but the same old arguments, endless scandals, corrupt officials counting money, poverty, and eternal conflicts.

Even though it would seem that everything should be clear, what is needed to live a little more comfortably. The camera rises higher and higher, as if escaping from this world, leaving the city in eternal darkness.

### Message

The film ultimately concludes that tragedy lies not only in wars, but also within people themselves. The system suffocates the younger generation, offering the same chains of servitude but under different words, symbols, and flags. Life seems terrible and hopeless. Wars have existed and will continue to exist, and you are just a small cog in the mechanism of a slave-owning democracy.
