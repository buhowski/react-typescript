#### Creative Experiments / Shows

# Self-Presentation Projects

Here you'll find ideas that can be brought to life without money, but not without proactive people ready to dive into the unknown for the sake of experience and fun.

If you're just starting out in content creation or are already there but lack ideas or want to try something new, all these projects, once we've implemented them, you'll be able to use on your own channels.
