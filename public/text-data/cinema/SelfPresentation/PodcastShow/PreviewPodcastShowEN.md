#### Comedy Podcast Show

# Dimension Minus Zero

An improvised mix of "The Eric Andre Show," "Between Two Ferns," and podcasts in the style of "Let's pretend we know something and we're fucking experts in everything" â€” with references, metaphorical subtext, unpredictable absurdity, and unapologetically dark, bad humor (nope).
