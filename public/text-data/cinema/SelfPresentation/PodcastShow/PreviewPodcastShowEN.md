#### Sketch Comedy / Talk Show

# Dimension Minus Zero

An improvised mix of [The Eric Andre Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2244495/), [Between Two Ferns](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9398640/), and podcasts in the style of "Let's pretend we know something and we're fucking experts in everything" â€” with references, metaphorical subtext, unpredictable absurdity, and unapologetically dark, bad humor (nope).
