#### Sketch Comedy / Talk Show

# Dimension Minus Zero

## Logline

An improvisational blend of [The Eric Andre Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2244495/), [Between Two Ferns](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9398640/), and podcasts in the style of "Let's pretend we know something and we're fucking experts in everything" — with references, metaphorical subtexts, unpredictable absurdity, and very outright black, fucked-up humor (not).

## Script

An improvisational show with prepared elements — a few minutes of conversation with media personalities (or whoever we can find). It features a disguised self-interview of the hosts, monologues, personal life stories, and other stuff. Guests are needed purely for background, broader audience reach, and comedic situations.

There are two hosts — a Main and an Additional (female + male) + a Background Character (possibly several) + a Guest.

- The Main host asks the main and any other questions (the main questions are specially prepared and necessary for revealing key ideas).
- All questions are directed at the guest, but the Additional host constantly seizes the initiative: answering all questions or interrupting the guest, adding their own versions of events.
- Both hosts need to expose the key idea as cool as possible, without letting the guest express themselves (if guests are even present — if they’re absent, the replacement is: dolls / plush toys that will be a-la-celebrities).
- The Background Character is constantly present, busy with their own things, but steps into character when the main question is over, or sometimes bursts into the conversation and interrupts everyone.
- In the case of using a doll as a guest, the Background Character plays the role of this “celebrity’s” thoughts or debates on any topic, joking that we are so unpopular that we couldn’t even get a homeless person to come. (The script for the Background Character's actions must be purely improvisational and unknown to the hosts).

## Wildcard: Background Character

- Examples of my vision for the character — videos in the slider (music, style, dances)
- Moves chaotically, changes into different costumes, dances, cooks, watches funny videos, laughs, creates a ruckus
- Creates chaos for a certain period between questions, destroying all the textures in the background

Another interpretation: The Character is an outdated mindset, a ghost of Christmas past that gradually becomes self-aware and strives to evolve. He is our cry from the soul.

## Metaphor: Textures

The idea for the location is an abandoned factory or a Soviet-style ruin: carpets, old TVs, 80s furniture.

During the show, the Background Character gradually destroys these elements. It’s not just decor, but the textures of an obsolete world that he replaces with new ones.

This is a visual metaphor for the desire to get rid of Soviet-era thinking, fucking medievalism, and build one’s own free world.

## Finale

The filming option moves to a studio with a cool designer interior, as if we had been there the whole time.

With the change of interior — the Background Character’s transformation: new suit, aristocratic pose, pipe, etc.

We show evolution in its purest form.

## Permanent Show Option

Raising three serious issues of modernity: social, human, global. And all this is diluted with chaotic humor so as not to go insane.

The ideas of textures are metaphors for these issues. The problem is solved by the Background Character, who destroys the old and replaces it with a new, healthy vision.

### Consider Adding

- Cool musical accompaniment / background music from a vinyl player, gramophone, or a giant radio (if broken but beautiful — put a speaker inside).
- A person off-camera who puts in their two cents, a-la a live audience.
- Hosts at an old table covered with newspapers: cut-glass tumblers, a bottle of vodka, a tea set, cookies, sandwiches — all homey, like a fancy New Year's table.
- A children's lullaby and a toy baby that cries from time to time, and we ignore it.
- Come up with different Easter eggs.
- If there's no guest — we invent that the guest is Revo, Portwine, a vibrator of a famous toxic person, or a clone from DNA we received by carrier pigeon.
- Nearby — a piece of plywood that can be punched with a yell of "KIYAA", or other similar things. Serves as an anti-stress gong / transition to the next bit.

## Scripted Bits

Danger Zone — unpredictably awful humor.

- Greeting: "This is the pilot episode... The pilot of a Broiler-747 passenger plane, which has been crashing for... (looks at a watch that isn't there) ...539 seconds (show duration)...", followed by the same laugh — first to the co-host, then to the camera, then to another camera (a reference to Kalambur)
- "Podcast-show-field-of-wonders", sector guest on the drum! Open the guest! We open a portrait on a stand (an ironic drawing, meme) and roll them in on a trolley
- A joke about some kind of prohibition: "Are we in Nazi Germany or something?”
- In the worst case — we'll just have a blast, in the best — two people will watch us
- I'll give it 5 years and the Apple company itself will call me directly and say: "Give me ten," and I'll say: "The old lady doesn't hear, nine or ten?"... And then I'll give them ten years in prison!
- If someone is a no-name, use absurd labels: "expert of shit and sticks", "some dick from the hill", "a fictional real person", "a beach bum"
- An argument for something: "A dick from the hill — 'cause from a hill you see better"
- So you're an IT guy? — Nah, IT guys are some awesome people, I’m a more functional organism

### Intro

Before the greeting, it starts immediately:

(in a calm, detached voice):

— A circus of freaks… fuck-ups... abominations… evolutionary defects… cracks on the testicles of the collective unconscious… faded textbook bitches who are stuck in 2007…

(the second host interrupts, continuing the same tone):

— Playing ahead of your desire for another attempt to vent your unresolved psychological issues on us, instead of finally going to a psychologist and stop pouring out your existential diarrhea in the comments, we’ll still say than…

(for a millisecond — silence. Then a strong, emotional, escalating scream takes over):

— THAAAAAANk GO FUCK YOURSELF, YOU FUCKING CUNT! YOU’RE DIRT FROM UNDER A FINGERNAIL! A CONSTANTLY LEAKING TOILET TANK! HALF A HEMORRHOID BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE! AN UNUSED LIFE PROMO CODE! A CUNT! A VIRGIN…

(a dramatic pause. Returns to a calm tone):

— We love you. Like your parents never did.

— ‘Cause that’s how real trust is built. Through pain, screaming, and the faint smell of booze.

(transition to the start of the show):

— Well, let’s fucking go.

— Welcome to the show. No one invited you, but since you're here — enjoy.
