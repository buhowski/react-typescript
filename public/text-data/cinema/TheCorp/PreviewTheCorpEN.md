#### Reality-Based Mockumentary / Series

# The Corp .!.

This is a mockumentary backstage series about creating [own corporation](/vision) from scratch. Itâ€™s an ironic reinterpretation of [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/) ideas, where a real work process is mixed with deliberate absurdity.
