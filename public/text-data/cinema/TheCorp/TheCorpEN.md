#### Reality-Based Mockumentary / Series

# The Corp .!.

## Logline

This is a mockumentary backstage series about creating [own corporation](/vision) from scratch. It’s an ironic reinterpretation of [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/) ideas, where a real work process is mixed with deliberate absurdity.

## Main Idea

This project immerses the viewer into the inner workings of a company being built from the ground up. The series offers a satirical look at the modern corporate world: fascism in the details, galleys and rowers, a talent meat grinder, the illusion of a family atmosphere, and the senseless waste of resources.

The story focuses not on business processes, but on the people who survive in offices where the main drama isn't the work itself, but everything that's done instead of it.

The goal of the series is to show, with boundless self-irony, what work should not be like. Documentary reality here is intertwined with intentionally integrated absurdity, which makes the project lively and captivating.

The open coverage of all stages of the corporation's creation will become not only the driving force behind the project's development but also its self-promotion.

Filming takes place in a real space. The series does not copy the original "The Office", but rather adapts its concept to create a unique story based on flexible humor, absurdity, and vivid characters.
