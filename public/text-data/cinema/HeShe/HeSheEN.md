## Main Idea

This is an epic mix of rap-rock opera and [Shakespearean poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare). Just as the film [Romeo + Juliet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/) updated the classic tragedy, this project transports biblical images into a modern urban world with the author's own twists. God is a lonely young girl, and the Devil is a charismatic guy who hides a deep spiritual loneliness.

They are not yet aware of each other's existence, but a twist of fate brings them together at a family masquerade ball, hosted for the young Goddess's birthday. The Devil's friends will sneak in without an invitation, and their first meeting will take place by the elevator, immediately sparking love at first sight.

At the party, the characters make countless attempts to cross paths and get to know each other, but each time something or someone distracts them. Their only conversation becomes a silent dialogue of inescapable gazes.

When they finally manage to hide from everyone, the first kiss is interrupted by a cruel reality: the uninvited guests have been exposed, and they need to flee immediately.

In the chaos of the escape, he learns the truth: the girl he fell in love with belongs to a family that is his eternal enemy. At that very moment, the girl realizes that the young man is the number one enemy of her clan. The faces of both, which a second ago shone with happiness, become distorted by pain and tragic disappointment. At this moment, love becomes a curse.

From the very beginning, the characters were not meant to be together. This love is forbidden by all the laws of the world. Their passion threatens to tear apart the fragile truce between the family business empires and unleash a new war that will reopen an ancient conflict and plunge the surrounding world into a whirlpool of unpredictable events.

### Scene Ideas

- Dialogues and scenes are rhymed, poetic, in the style of Shakespeare
- The characters' emotions are conveyed through a mystical background: changing weather, sudden thunderstorms, downpours, and other natural disasters reflect their inner state.
- Conflicts are a poetic mix of medieval duels with modern weapons.
