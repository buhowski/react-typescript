## Main Idea

This is an epic blend of a rap-rock opera and Shakespearean poetry. Similar to how the film [Romeo + Juliet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117509/) updated a classic tragedy, this project transplants biblical figures into a modern, urban world with original twists. God is a lonely young girl, and the Devil is a charismatic guy who hides a deep, spiritual loneliness.

They don't know of each other's existence yet, but fate will bring them together at a family masquerade ball, held in honor of the young Goddess's birthday. The Devil’s friends will sneak in uninvited, and their first encounter will be by the elevator, immediately becoming love at first sight.

At the party, the protagonists make countless attempts to cross paths and get to know each other, but each time something or someone distracts them. Their only conversation becomes a silent dialogue of inescapable glances. When they finally manage to hide from everyone, their first kiss is interrupted by a harsh reality: the uninvited guests have been exposed, and they must flee immediately.

In the chaos of their escape, he learns the truth: the girl he fell in love with belongs to a family that is his family's eternal enemy. At that very moment, the girl realizes the young man is her family's number one foe. The faces of both, which were glowing with happiness just a second ago, become contorted with pain and tragic disappointment. In this moment, love becomes a curse.

From the very beginning, the protagonists were not meant to be together. This love is forbidden by all the laws of the world. Their passion threatens to tear apart the fragile truce between the family business empires and unleash a new war that will open an ancient conflict and plunge the surrounding world into a whirlpool of unpredictable events.

### Scene Ideas

- Dialogues and scenes are rhyming, poetic, in the style of Shakespeare
- The characters’ emotions are conveyed through a mystical backdrop: changes in weather, unexpected thunderstorms, downpours, and other natural disasters mirror their internal state
- Conflicts are a poetic blend of medieval duels with modern weapons
