# Shadows of the Cossacks: Quantum Leap

***Saga:** Part III*

## Logline

Centuries after the world abandoned religion, new alliances led by the Cossack Legion must unite to stop a totalitarian enemy that seeks to wipe continents he deems repulsive from the face of the Earth.

## Core Idea

The third part begins with a series of dynamic cinematic sequences that recap the events of the previous parts: [Part I](/cossacks-saga-1), [Part II](/cossacks-saga-2).

The scenes accelerate, showing how the ruins of the ancient world become futuristic cities, and tribes evolve into new civilizations. Time, compressed into a single stream, reveals an unknown world history where futurism intertwines with the legacy of ancient cultures.

Centuries after the destruction of the church's demonic influence, humanity, having abandoned religions, directed the remnants of magic towards the development of technology. This gave a push to a rapid evolutionary leap that completely changed the course of history and gave rise to a world in which a new society is based on self-belief, the strength of family, and mutual support. In this world, Cossacks, Vikings, and Native Americans have established their own technologically advanced colonies that either cooperate or maintain neutrality.

However, such a world was not acceptable to everyone. A surviving fragment of evil found refuge in a new owner — a person who mastered extraordinary powers. By integrating the forgotten knowledge of the otherworldly into technology, he created neuro-engineering for mind control and an army of robotic people. This totalitarian enemy seeks to subjugate or destroy all who do not fit his idea of an ideal new-generation race.

This conflict proves that the greatest evil is not demons but humanity's thirst for power, which always lurks and seeks opportunities to manifest. It reminds everyone that even in the most progressive future, the war never ends.

Our mission is to unite with all possible factions to prevent total annihilation. We must delve into the ancient knowledge and memories of primeval evil, assemble a team of the best, and embark on a dangerous journey to withstand the attacks of the robotic army and prevent the creation of the world's most dangerous weapon.

An unexpected greeting from the past also awaits us — an heir to the fragments of ancient love, because evil is not the only thing that lives forever.
