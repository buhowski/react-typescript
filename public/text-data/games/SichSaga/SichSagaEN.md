# Shadows of Sich: Saga

An epic video game series and a journey through time that begins in the 9th-century Kyivan Rus' and leads to an alternate cyber-future. This is a story where the destruction of religion becomes the impetus for an unprecedented technological leap.

Through the destinies of mysterious heroes, we uncover religious conspiracies, demonic cults, and otherworldly forces that have shaped the world. This is a fight for freedom and love, the discovery of forbidden truths, and a choice that will change humanity's future.

The world evolves from an authentic Middle Ages with magic and mythological creatures â€” to a tribal scientific futurism, where the magic of the past has been transformed into the technology of the future. In each era, an indestructible cultural heritage clashes with an eternal evil that always finds a new host, proving that the war never ends.
