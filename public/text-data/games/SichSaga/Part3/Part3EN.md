# Shadows of Sich: Quantum Leap

***A Saga:** Part III*

## Logline

Centuries after the world abandoned religion and transformed magic into technology, new alliances led by the Cossack Legion must unite to face a totalitarian enemy forging a weapon capable of erasing entire continents from the map.

## Core Idea

The introduction to the third chapter begins with a series of dynamic cinematic cutscenes recreating the events of the previous parts [Part I](/sich-saga-1), [Part II](/sich-saga-2) — the moment that forever reshaped the world. Then the pace accelerates: ruins of the ancient world morph into futuristic cities, tribes evolve into new civilizations, and time, compressed into a single flow, unveils an untold history.

Centuries after the eradication of the church’s demonic influence and humanity’s rejection of religion, the remnants of magic were redirected toward technological development. This sparked a rapid evolutionary leap that completely changed the course of history, giving rise to a world where futurism intertwines with the legacy of ancient cultures. The new society is built on self-belief, family strength, collective work, and mutual support.

In this new world, Cossacks, Vikings, and Native Americans were not wiped out but instead founded advanced technological colonies that either cooperated with one another or remained neutral.

Yet this world was not acceptable to everyone. A fragment of surviving evil found refuge in a new host — a man who gained extraordinary powers. Using forgotten knowledge of the afterlife, he integrated it into technology, creating neuroengineering of mind control and an army of robotic humans. This previously unknown totalitarian enemy seeks to conquer the world, subjugating or annihilating all who do not fit his vision of a perfect race of a new generation.

This conflict proves that the greatest evil is not demons but humanity’s lust for power, forever lurking, waiting to surface. It reminds us that even in the most progressive future, war never ends.

Our mission is to unite with every possible faction to resist total annihilation. We must delve into ancient knowledge and the memories of primordial evil, assemble the finest team, embark on a perilous journey, prevent the creation of the world’s most dangerous weapon, and withstand assaults by robotic humans. An unexpected echo from the Middle Ages also awaits us — an heir to the fragments of an ancient love, for not only evil lives forever!

## Description

The game world is a fusion of tribal futurism and the mythological heritage of different peoples: Slavic, Scandinavian, Native American, Asian, and African.

### Choice of Path and Faction

At the start of the game, you create your hero and choose a faction, which determines a unique prologue and playstyle.

- Cossack Legion: a warrior brotherhood combining diplomacy and advanced nano-weapons. Together with the Vikings, they form a mighty alliance protecting the Euro-Continent.
- Vikings of the New Era: militant clans who merged ancient runic knowledge with cybernetic technology and robotics. This part of the alliance stands for freedom and independence.
- Maya-Fusion: Native Americans revived the grandeur of their temples and tribes, living in harmony with nature and using biotechnology and solar energy to protect their lands.
- Nomads of the Starry Sky: North American tribes preserved their unique culture, blending a nomadic way of life with astronomy and space technology. They roam vast territories, drawing strength from celestial bodies and prototypes of flying machines.
- African Tribes: a continent where the enemy first tested his nano-weapons. Refugees preserved their mythology and culture, integrating into new alliances under the protection of the Cossack Legion.
- Asian Totalitarianism: the main enemy, emerging after its leader seized a fragment of ancient evil. The regime mercilessly destroyed everything standing in the way of absolute power and now seeks to subjugate the world with nano-weapons.
