# Cossacks RPG

***Format:** An adventure role-playing video game with an open world and a third-person view, high detailed environment and characters*

***Setting:** Ukraine of the 16th — 18th centuries, Zaporozhian Sich*

## Core Idea

A mighty Zaporozhian Cossack with a tragic past and untapped supernatural potential travels through cities, trying to unravel the secrets of mystical history and his own past.

Accidentally, he becomes entangled in dark conspiracies of the clergy and uncovers forbidden secrets that lead to the truth he has long sought — but now knows he cannot escape alive after what he has seen

This story weaves together real historical facts, mythology and demonology, dynamic comedy, and tragic drama.

## Overview

The concept of my idea is to combine real historical events of the Ukrainian Cossacks with Slavic myths and mysticism from the literary works of Nikolai Gogol (ideas, themes, and atmosphere). To imagine my vision of the game's visuals, you need to take the Zaporozhian Cossacks (images 03-08) and combine them with the graphic style of videos 01-02, but with its own themes and textures, combined with a melancholically dark atmosphere of a forgotten era, mysticism, and personal drama.

The result will be a game that brings to life the history of the Ukrainian Cossacks and the Zaporozhian Sich. My goal is to popularize a new vision of that period and show the images of different Cossacks in a new style. Openly depicting the whole essence of that era — bloody battles, cruelty, betrayal, untold legends, and explicit scenes. It will also show the famous hopak dance, humor, and endless landscapes.
