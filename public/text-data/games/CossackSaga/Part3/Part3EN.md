# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Quantum Leap

***A Saga:** Part III*

## Logline

Centuries after the world abandoned religion and transformed magic into technology, new alliances led by the Cossack Legion must unite to confront a totalitarian enemy wielding weapons capable of destroying entire continents.

## Main Idea

The introduction to the third part begins with a series of dynamic cinematic inserts that briefly recount key moments from the previous parts and the finale of the second, which drastically changed the world. This sequence smoothly transitions into a montage showcasing the "Quantum Leap" — the development of new civilizations born from the ruins of the old world.

Centuries after the demonic evil was vanquished and the world renounced religion, humanity, having gained new knowledge and beginning to believe only in itself, channeled the remnants of magical energy into the development of technologies. This led to an extraordinary evolutionary leap that completely changed all of known history, creating a world where technology and ancient cultures intertwined.

It is in this new world that the Cossacks, Vikings, and Native Americans were not annihilated. On the contrary, they united, sharing their secrets and histories with one another. The destruction of the ultimate evil led to the collapse of all religious manifestations, putting an end to wars over gods. The foundation of the new society became mutual self-improvement and cooperation.

However, this peace proved to be an illusion. A fragment of evil that could not be destroyed found refuge in Asia, where its leader gained extraordinary powers. Using lost otherworldly knowledge, he infused it into technology, creating neuro-engineering for mind control and an army of robotic humans. This previously unseen totalitarian enemy seeks to conquer the world, enslaving or destroying all who do not fit his racial ideals.

This conflict proves that the greatest evil is not demons but the human thirst for power, which always lurks and seeks opportunities to manifest again. It reminds everyone that even in the most progressive future, war never ends.

Our mission is to unite with all possible factions to resist complete annihilation. We need to assemble a team of the best warriors and scientists to embark on a journey to prevent the creation of the most dangerous weapon and to withstand constant attacks from robotic humans. We also await an unexpected greeting from the Middle Ages, which is the last hope to counteract such potent evil, for evil is not the only thing that lives forever!

## Description

The game world exists at the intersection of several eras — a blend of tribal futurism and the mythological heritage of various peoples (Slavic, Scandinavian, Native American, Asian, and African).

### Main Factions. Concept of Choice

At the beginning of the game, you create your hero and choose a faction, which shapes a unique prologue and gameplay experience.

- Cossack Legion: A martial brotherhood specializing in diplomacy and advanced nanoweapons. Together with the Vikings, they formed a powerful alliance standing guard over continental Europe.
- New Era Vikings: Warlike clans that have combined ancient runic knowledge with cybernetic technologies and robotics. They are the second part of the mighty alliance defending freedom.
- Maya-Fusion: Indigenous Americans who have revived the grandeur of their temples. These are tribes living in harmony with nature, utilizing biotechnology and solar energy for protection.
- Starry Sky Nomads: Tribes of North America who have preserved their unique culture by combining a nomadic lifestyle with advanced astronomy and cosmology. They roam vast expanses, relying on the power of celestial bodies and the first prototypes of aircraft.
- African Tribes: Africa was the first continent where Asian nanoweapons were tested. These refugees have preserved their unique mythology and culture, integrating into new alliances under the protection of the Cossack Legion.
- Asian Totalitarianism: This is the main enemy, which arose after its leader found a fragment of ancient evil. The regime destroyed everything that stood in its way to absolute power and seeks to enslave the world, subjugating it with nanoweapons.
