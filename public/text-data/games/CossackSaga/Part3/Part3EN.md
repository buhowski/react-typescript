# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Quantum Leap

***Saga:** Part III*

## Logline

Centuries after the world rejected religion and transformed magic into technology, new alliances led by the Cossack Legion must unite to face an unprecedented totalitarian enemy. Wielding weapons capable of destroying continents, this foe reminds everyone that even in the most advanced future, war never ends, for a shard of evil has found its bearer.

## Main Idea

The introduction to the third part begins with a series of dynamic cinematic cutscenes that briefly recap the key moments of the previous parts and the finale of Part II, which fundamentally changed the world. This sequence smoothly transitions into a montage that showcases the "Quantum Leap" — the rise of new civilizations born from the ruins of the old world.

Centuries after demonic forces were defeated and the world rejected religion, humanity, having gained new knowledge and begun to believe only in itself, directed the remnants of magical energy toward technological development. This led to an extraordinary evolutionary leap that completely changed all known history, creating a world where technology and ancient cultures intertwine.

In this new world, Cossacks, Vikings, and Native Americans were not destroyed. On the contrary, they began to unite, sharing their secrets and histories with one another. The eradication of the main evil led to the collapse of all religious manifestations worldwide, putting an end to wars over gods and paganism. The new society's foundation became shared self-improvement and mutual aid.

However, this peace proved to be an illusion. A part of the evil found refuge in Asia, where its leader acquired extraordinary powers. Using lost knowledge from the otherworld, he infused it into technology, creating neuro-engineering for mind control and nanotechnological weapons capable of pinpoint destruction of entire territories.

Now this unprecedented totalitarian enemy seeks to conquer the world, enslaving or destroying all who do not conform to his racial views. This conflict proves that the greatest evil is not demons, but the human lust for power, which always lurks and seeks opportunities to manifest again.

## Description
