# **Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Quantum Leap**

***A Saga:** Part III*

## Logline

A century after the world abandoned religion and transformed magic into technology, new alliances led by the Cossack Legion must unite to confront a totalitarian enemy creating a weapon capable of destroying entire continents.

## Main Idea

The introduction to Part III begins with a series of dynamic cinematics that briefly recap the key moments of previous parts and the finale of Part II, which fundamentally changed the world. This segment smoothly transitions into a montage showcasing the "Quantum Leap" â€” the evolution of new civilizations born on the ruins of the old world.

A century after the demonic evil was destroyed and humanity rejected religion, it directed the remnants of magical energy toward the development of technology. This led to an extraordinary evolutionary leap that completely changed our known history, creating a world where technology and ancient cultures intertwined. The foundation of the new society became self-belief, family development, collective effort, and mutual assistance.

In this new world, Cossacks, Vikings, and Native Americans were not eradicated but created their own advanced technological colonies that cooperated with each other or maintained neutrality.

However, such a world was not acceptable to everyone. A fragment of evil that could not be destroyed found refuge, where its owner gained extraordinary powers. Using lost knowledge from the otherworld, he imbued it into technology, creating neuro-engineering for mind control and an army of robotic people. This unprecedented totalitarian enemy seeks to conquer the world, enslaving or destroying all who do not conform to his vision of a new-generation race.

This conflict proves that the greatest evil is not demons but humanity's lust for power, which always lies in wait, seeking an opportunity to re-emerge. It reminds everyone that even in the most progressive future, the war never ends.

Our mission is to unite with all possible factions to counter complete annihilation. We must delve into the ancient knowledge and memories of the primordial evil, assemble a team of the best, and embark on a journey to prevent the creation of the most dangerous weapon and resist the attacks of the robotic people. We also await an unexpected greeting from the Middle Ages, which is our last hope against such a powerful evil, for after all, it is not only evil that lives forever!

## Description

- Star Sky Nomads: Tribes of North America that have preserved their unique culture by combining a nomadic lifestyle with advanced astronomy and space technologies. They wander the vast expanses, relying on the power of cosmic bodies and the first prototypes of flying machines.
- African Tribes: Africa became the first continent where the enemies tested their nano-weapons. These refugees have preserved their unique mythology and culture, integrating into new alliances under the protection of the Cossack Legion.
