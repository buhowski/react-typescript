# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Whispers of the Forgotten

***A Saga:** Part I*

## Logline

A traveler without memory accidentally witnesses a mysterious ritual performed by clerics and realizes that dark forces are fighting within him due to an unfinished demonic baptism. Meanwhile, the servants of the dark path plan to conquer the world — and only the hero can uncover their secrets.

## Main Idea

This is an adventure Action/RPG with an open world. The core concept revolves around exploring a mysterious world where real history, Slavic mythology, and demonology are woven into a single game lore.

The game focuses on unraveling the secrets of mystical rituals, internal struggles, and self-discovery, with the main character — a mysterious figure with a tragic past — seeking allies to uncover a grand conspiracy that threatens the world.

### Plot

The hero is 25–30 years old and remembers nothing except fragments of his childhood up to the age of six. While searching for the truth, he accidentally stumbles upon a mysterious ritual. A sense of deja vu pierces his mind, unlocking his first true memory:

- He had once undergone a demonic baptism that was interrupted. His body became a battleground for dark forces, but evil did not fully possess him, leaving traces in the form of unique abilities that he has yet to control.

From that moment, his life changes forever. Church officials recognize him, and from then on, every step becomes a fight for his survival.

He finds salvation among the hermit Cossacks, who possess ancient knowledge. They guide him deep into his memory, where the hero uncovers a new recollection:

- The church stole his past, shattering his consciousness into fragments.

To restore the broken story of his life, the hero sets out on a journey. Along the way, he encounters various adventurers who become his allies.

Each new memory fragment (an interactive flashback) initially seems chaotic and out of context, but gradually, through logical connections and intrigue, they form a complete and detailed picture, revealing betrayals, losses, friendship, love, secrets of the afterlife, and a power he gradually learns to master.

The climax occurs when the hero discovers that the final fragment is a living person whom the Supreme Lord plans to burn at the stake as a witch.

As he infiltrates the ritual site, he sees her — his lost heroine. The memory strikes him like a blow:

- They once lived together in the wilderness, trying to hide from the world. Love flourished, they dreamed and made plans. But the church found their settlement and burned everything to the ground. His beloved was killed before his eyes, and the hero’s consciousness was shattered into fragments.

Everyone assumed he was dead, but a protective mechanism of otherworldly forces preserved his life. Awakening amid the ruins, he finds himself in a whirlwind of confusion due to complete memory loss and chaotic inner struggle.

Now, with the truth revealed, he must make a choice that will determine their shared fate.

## Description

Imagine gameplay that combines the world-building depth of The Witcher 3, the parkour dynamism of Assassin’s Creed, and the cinematic combat direction of NieR: RepliCant/Automata — all seamlessly integrated into our unique historical-mystical world. Yet these are only reference points — the game offers its own unique design vision.

### Setting & Atmosphere

The narrative weaves together real events from the territories of modern Ukraine between the 10th and 18th centuries, Slavic mythology, demonology, and dynamic comedy. A melancholic and somber atmosphere of a forgotten age intertwines with mysticism and personal drama.

The game questions established historical narratives, particularly the motives behind the Baptism of Kievan Rus and the role of religion. Betrayals, brutal battles, forgotten legends, and sharp dramatic moments immerse the player in the depth of the era, making it both vivid and perilous. Varied characters, along with magical and cultural elements, create a singular, living atmosphere for the world.

### Hermit Cossacks

Unique "gypsy punks" — nomadic tribal recluses who embody warriors, sorcerers, seers, and shamans. They live by their own laws: friendly, fearless, and free, blending magic with martial skills. They often act as advisors, mercenaries, or choose to follow their own path.

### Game World

- Locations and Environment: The core regions of the game include the Zaporizhian Sich, the Carpathians, Volhynia, Kyivan Rus, Crimea, and more. Each region features its most captivating locations — camps, ruins, caves, temples, and fortresses — condensed into an interactive map that preserves the atmosphere of history and mysticism.
- Mythology and Magic: Ancient Slavic legends intertwine with history, shaping a unique mystical lore. Demonology and magic are integral to the life of nomadic Cossacks, and their legends influence the fates of heroes and reveal hidden truths.
- Interactivity: Quests and NPCs allow players to reshape the story, affect characters’ destinies, and uncover hidden layers of mythology, immersing them in the atmosphere of a magical and historical world.

- Culture and Mythology: The Zaporizhian Cossacks, Slavic mythology, and demonology — for authenticity, magic, and folkloric lore.
- Drama and Emotions: The full palette of human emotions — from triumphs to tragedies
- Storytelling and Alternate History: Multiple narrative paths that challenge established historical narratives and create a dramatic, original storyline.

## Conclusion

I am looking support and a team to bring this unique world to life. This is an opportunity to merge real historical events with mysticism and craft a powerful next-generation game series about the Cossacks. My vision brings forgotten stories to life and shapes alternate worlds capable of becoming true global masterpieces.
