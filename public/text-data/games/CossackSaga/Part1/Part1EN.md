#### Dark Fantasy Adventure / Action RPG

# **Shadows of the Cossacks**: Whispers of the Forgotten

***Saga:** Part I*

## Logline

Lost amidst fragmented memories, a mysterious traveler seeks the truth of his origins, for his body has become a battlefield for dark forces. He doesn't yet realize that his past is the only key to saving the world from a massive conspiracy.

## Main Idea

This is an open-world Action/RPG adventure. The main concept is exploring a mysterious universe where real history, Slavic mythology, and demonology are intertwined into a single game lore.

The game focuses on unraveling the mysteries of mystical rituals, internal struggle, and self-discovery. The main character, a mysterious figure with a tragic past, seeks allies to expose a grand conspiracy that threatens the world.

### Plot

The hero is between 25 and 30 years old. He remembers nothing but fragments of his childhood up to the age of six. While searching for the truth, he accidentally stumbles upon a mysterious ritual. A sense of déjà vu pierces his consciousness, unlocking his first true memory:

- A demonic baptism was once performed on him, but it was interrupted. His body became an arena for a battle of dark forces, but evil did not fully possess him, leaving a trace in the form of unique abilities he cannot yet control.

From this moment on, his life changes forever. The church's servants recognized him, and since then, every step has become a flight for his life.

He finds refuge with a group of Cossack hermits who possess ancient knowledge. They guide him into his memory, where the hero uncovers a new fragmented memory:

- The church stole his past, tearing his consciousness into pieces.

To restore the shattered story of his life, the hero embarks on a journey. Along the way, he meets various adventurers who become his allies.

Each new memory fragment (an interactive flashback) at first seems chaotic and ripped from context. However, gradually, through logical connections and intrigues, they form a complete and detailed picture, revealing betrayals, losses, friendship, love, otherworldly secrets, and the power he is slowly learning to tame.

The climax occurs when the hero learns that the last fragment is a living person whom the supreme lord is preparing to burn at the stake as a witch.

Infiltrating the ritual site, he sees her — his lost love. The memory hits him like a blow:

- They once lived together in seclusion, trying to hide from the world. They were in love, dreaming and making plans. But the church found their settlement and burned everything to the ground. His beloved was killed before his eyes, and the hero's consciousness was torn into fragments.
- Everyone believed he had perished, but the protective mechanism of otherworldly forces worked and saved his life. Waking up in the ashes, he found himself in a state of confusion due to complete memory loss and chaotic internal struggle.

Now, with the truth revealed, he must make a choice that will determine their shared destiny.

## Description

Imagine gameplay that combines the world depth of [The Witcher 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/), the parkour dynamics of [Assassin's Creed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/33230/Assassins_Creed_2/), and the cinematic combat staging of [NieR: RepliCant](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113560/NieR_Replicant_ver122474487139/) / [Automata](https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/), all integrated into our unique historical-mystical world. These are only reference points — the game offers its own, unique design vision.

### Setting & Atmosphere

The plot combines real events from the territories of modern Ukraine from the 10th-18th centuries, Slavic mythology, demonology, a melancholic-dark atmosphere, personal drama, and light humor that harmoniously weaves in without breaking the mystical mood.

The game questions established historical narratives, particularly the motives for the baptism of Kyivan Rus and the role of religion. It immerses the player in a world dominated by betrayals, bloody battles, forgotten legends, and sharp scenes that make the era feel alive and dangerous. A variety of characters, as well as magical and cultural elements, create a unique, vibrant world atmosphere.

### Hermit Cossacks

**Unique Gypsy Punks** — nomadic tribal recluses who combine warriors, sorcerers, seers, and shamans. They live by their own laws: friendly, fearless, and free, they combine magic and combat skills, often serving as advisors or mercenaries, or choosing their own path.

### Antagonist Clan

The Supreme Leader — **"The Pope's Throne"**, the heart of the conspiracy. His goal is to subjugate the world to his order, using demonic pacts to control all religions and politics.

Local Groups — subordinates with their own leaders, assistants, and servants. Created for each faith around the world, they infiltrate regions, seize local churches and cult institutions, using rituals and demonic interventions to gradually lead people to the dark side.

### Game World

- **Locations and Environment:** The main regions of the game are the Zaporizhzhian Sich, the Carpathians, Kyivan Rus, and others. The most interesting locations will be selected for each region — camps, ruins, caves, temples, and fortresses — all connected on an interactive map that preserves the atmosphere of history and mysticism.
- **Mythology and Magic:** Deep Slavic legends are intertwined with history, forming a unique mystical lore. Demonology and magic are integral to the lives of the nomadic Cossacks, and their legends influence the fates of the heroes and reveal hidden truths.
- **Interactivity:** Quests and NPCs allow the player to change the course of the plot, influence the fates of characters, and uncover hidden aspects of mythology, immersing them in the atmosphere of a magical and historical world.

## Conclusion

No known religion or historical figure participated in the creation of this conspiracy. All coincidences with events are an artistic and psychological assessment of society under certain conditions.

I am seeking support and a team to bring this unique world to life. This is an opportunity to combine real events with mysticism and create a powerful new-generation game series about the Cossacks. My vision brings unknown stories to life and shapes alternative worlds capable of becoming true global masterpieces.
