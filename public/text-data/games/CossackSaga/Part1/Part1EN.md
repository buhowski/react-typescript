# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich

***Format:** An adventure role-playing video game with an open world and a third-person view, high detailed environment and characters*

***Setting:** Ukraine of the 16th — 18th centuries, Zaporozhian Sich*

## Main Idea

A mysterious figure with a tragic past and an unrevealed potential for otherworldly powers, travels through cities, trying to uncover the mystical secrets of history and his own destiny.

He accidentally gets entangled in dark church conspiracies and uncovers forbidden secrets that lead to the truth he's long sought — but now he knows he won't get out alive after what he's seen.

Here, we intertwine real historical facts, mythology and demonology, dynamic comedy — all combined with a melancholically dark atmosphere of a forgotten era, mysticism, and personal drama.

## Overview

The core concept of my idea lies in combining real historical events of the Ukrainian Cossacks with Slavic myths and the mysticism from Mykola Gogol's literary works.

To understand my vision for the game world, you need to take Cossacks and combine their visual style with the video examples in the slider, but with our own theme. The result will be a game that will bring to life the history of Ukrainian Cossacks and the Zaporozhian Sich.

My goal is to popularize a new vision of that period and showcase various Cossack figures in a fresh style. This means frankly depicting the full essence of that era — bloody battles, cruelty, betrayal, untold legends, and explicit scenes. Also, to feature the renowned combat dance "hopak," humor, and boundless landscapes that haven't been explored in games yet.
