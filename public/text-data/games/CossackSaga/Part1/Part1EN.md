# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Whispers of the Forgotten

***A Saga:** Part I*

## Logline

A traveler with no memory stumbles upon a clerical conspiracy and learns that dark forces are battling inside him due to an incomplete demonic baptism. At the same time, the clergymen, who are themselves under demonic control, seek to seize the entire world.

## Main Idea

The main protagonist, a mysterious figure with a tragic past, travels from town to town, trying to unravel the mystical secrets of his own destiny. He has no recollection of the events from 20 years ago that led to his current state, but he accidentally finds himself at the center of a dark clerical conspiracy and uncovers the truth of his origin, forbidden secrets, and who is truly behind it all. After what he sees, he realizes there's no way out alive.

Gradually, through a series of playable flashbacks from his childhood, the hero uncovers the essence of the religious demonism that hides behind church authority. His memories take him back to horrific events—murders, violence, the loss of a loved one—that are the key to understanding his inner struggle. His otherworldly powers are a consequence of a partial demonic baptism that was interrupted in his childhood, granting him unique abilities but not fully possessing him.

The hero's goal is to find help to unravel the mysteries of the rituals and to confront the internal struggle between good and evil. He must learn to control his powers, regain his lost memories, which will be the key to the entire story, and find a way to resist the dark invaders.

The plot intertwines real historical events, mythology, demonology, and dynamic comedy. This is all presented in a melancholic, dark atmosphere of a forgotten era, filled with mysticism and personal drama. The game also touches upon alternative historical timelines, questioning established narratives, particularly the true motives behind the Baptism of Kyivan Rus' and religion itself.

## Description

Core Concept: A combination of Ukrainian history from the 10th-18th centuries with alternative timelines that directly depend on the player's choices. This all takes place against a backdrop of Slavic myths, the mysticism of Gogol, and the author's unique vision of the world.

To get an approximate idea of the game's world, take the style of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the unique theme of hermit-Cossacks. Combine this with the mechanics of The Witcher 3, Ghost of Tsushima, parkour elements from Assassin's Creed, as well as the unsurpassed boss fight direction inspired by Nier: Automata, which makes them spectacular and unpredictable. All these examples serve only as a reference, as this game has an absolutely unique design vision.

Hermit-Cossacks are unique "gypsy punks": tribal recluses, sorcerers, and soothsayers living in nomadic camps. They combine magic, fearlessness, and freedom, acting as mercenaries, advisors, or choosing their own path. Ultimately, this is a game that will breathe life into the history of Ukrainian Cossackdom, offer an alternative vision, and add a new magical and cultural dimension.

### Goal

To popularize a new, deeper vision of this period through diverse Cossack characters. We will candidly portray the essence of the era — bloody battles, brutality, betrayal, forgotten legends, and dramatic scenes. At the same time, we will recreate a unique atmosphere: the combat dance Hopak, folk traditions, humor, and the endless Ukrainian landscapes that have so far been overlooked by the gaming industry.

## Conclusion

This is a desire to combine real historical facts with mysticism and humor to create a powerful new-generation game series about the Cossacks. My vision makes it possible to bring untold stories to life and create new ideas that can become worldwide masterpieces.

I am looking for support and a team to realize this project, which will reveal the Cossacks from a new perspective, inspire the exploration of untouched history, and enable the creation of boundless alternative worlds. All that's needed is a united team and resources — and words will become reality.
