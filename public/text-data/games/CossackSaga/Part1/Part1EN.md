# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Whispers of the Forgotten

***Saga:** Part I*

## Logline

A mysterious traveler with no memory accidentally stumbles upon an ecclesiastical conspiracy and recovers a fragment of a memory. He discovers the truth of his origin: dark forces, a result of an incomplete demonic baptism, are battling inside him, while the priesthood seeks to subjugate every human soul by bringing the whole world under their demonic control.

## Main Idea

The main protagonist, a mysterious figure with a tragic past, travels from town to town, trying to unravel the mystical secrets of his own destiny. He has no recollection of the events from 20 years ago that led to his current state.

He accidentally finds himself at the center of a dark clerical conspiracy and uncovers forbidden secrets that lead to the truth he's been searching for his whole life. Now, having seen everything, he realizes there's no way out alive.

Gradually, through a series of flashbacks from his childhood, the hero uncovers the essence of the religious demonism that hides behind church authority. His memories take him back to horrific events—murders, violence, the loss of a loved one—that are key to understanding his inner struggle. His otherworldly powers are a consequence of a partial demonic baptism that was interrupted in his childhood, granting him unique abilities.

The plot intertwines real historical facts, mythology, demonology, and dynamic comedy. This is all presented in a melancholic, dark atmosphere of a forgotten era, mystery, and personal drama. The game also touches upon alternative historical timelines, questioning established narratives, particularly the true motives behind the Baptism of Kyivan Rus.

## Description

The concept is a fusion of real historical events from 10th-18th century Ukraine (from the Baptism of Kyivan Rus to the Cossack era) with alternative timelines. This is set against a backdrop of Slavic myths, the mysticism of Mykola Gogol, and the author's unique vision of the world.

To imagine the game world, one should take the visual style of the Zaporizhian Cossacks and combine it with elements from The Witcher and Ghost of Tsushima game series, adding the unique theme of the hermit Cossacks.

These "gypsy punks" are nomadic recluses, sorcerers, and seers who live in traveling camps. They embody a mix of magic, fearlessness, and freedom, acting as mercenaries, advisors, or coming to serve in the Zaporizhian Sich. The result will be a game that brings the history of Ukrainian Cossacks to life, offers an alternative view of religious influence, and adds a new magical and cultural dimension.

The goal is to popularize a new, deeper vision of this period through diverse Cossack characters. We will candidly portray the essence of the era—bloody battles, cruelty, betrayal, forgotten legends, and edgy scenes. At the same time, we will recreate a unique atmosphere: the combat dance Hopak, folk traditions, humor, and the endless Ukrainian landscapes that remain largely unexplored in the gaming industry.
