# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Ashes of the Beloved

***Saga:** Part II*

## Logline

Rescued from the clutches of death, our heroine possesses only a fragment of her beloved's soul. Driven by an unbreakable spirit and a thirst for revenge, she embarks on a bloody journey to destroy the church hierarchy that condemned her to torment and suffering. On her path to reuniting with her beloved, she's willing to pay any price, for death is merely a new beginning. If this is true, she will take as much evil with her as she can to destroy it forever.

## Main Idea

The events of Part II begin immediately after the tragic conclusion of the first. Rescued at the cost of her beloved's life, the heroine finds refuge with his old friends. There, she not only regains her strength but also learns all the secrets the hero had uncovered.

Armed with new knowledge about demonology and the church's rituals, she realizes that the church hierarchy has been taken over by a main demon who controls his minions through rituals and demonic baptisms.

Now the victim transforms into a hunter. Her past, spent in the clerics' captivity, is revealed through a series of brutal flashbacks that showcase not only her suffering but also her unbreakable thirst for freedom. This realization drives her to embark on a bloody journey to do what is right, for it's no longer clear what is good and what is evil â€” only the consequences of our actions remain.

The heroine's main goal is not just revenge, but the complete destruction of the possessed servants of evil who condemned her to torment. Her fight for her beloved is a fight for the entire world, and she is willing to transcend the boundaries of humanity to put an end to the demonic rule once and for all.

At the end of this journey, a final battle awaits her. Her goal is not only to resurrect her beloved and destroy the main demon but also to end the false religion, injecting new knowledge into the world to allow it to develop freely without possession or control. Whether she succeeds, and whether her sacrifice leads to a new world or to complete chaos, remains unknown.
