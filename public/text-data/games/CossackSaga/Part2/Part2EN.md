# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Ashes of the Beloved

***A Saga:** Part II*

## Logline

Saved from certain death, the heroine possesses only a fragment of her beloved's soul. Driven by an unbreakable spirit and a thirst for revenge, she embarks on a bloody journey to destroy the church's supremacy, which condemned her to torment and suffering.

## Main Idea

The events of Part II begin immediately after the tragic conclusion of Part I. Saved by the price of her beloved's life, the heroine finds refuge with his friends. There, she not only regains her strength but also learns all the secrets revealed by the hero, about how she might still try to save her savior, and about the powers that remain in the ashes of his soul.

Armed with new knowledge of demonology and rituals, she realizes that the church is controlled by a chief demon who manipulates his followers through rites and demonic baptisms. Now the victim transforms into a hunter. Her past, spent in captivity to these demons, is revealed through a series of playable flashbacks that show her suffering, an unbreakable desire for freedom, and a desperate wish to be reunited with her love.

This realization compels her to embark on a bloody journey. She is ready to pay any price, for death is just a new beginning for her. The heroine's main goal is not only revenge but also the hope that the truth lies in the fragment of his soul. To do this, she must travel a great distance, and she is ready to destroy all the possessed scum that crosses her path. Her struggle is for the fate of the entire world, and she is willing to cross the bounds of humanity to bring back her love and end the demonic rule once and for all.

At the end of this journey, a final battle awaits us, and her ultimate goal is not only the resurrection and destruction of the chief demon but also to put an end to the false religion from which it all began, instilling new knowledge into a world that will allow it to develop freely without obsession, idolatry, or control.

Or chaos will take over the world, and the demons will be proven right that a world more comfortable with being a herd is incorrigible. In such a case, the choice could lead to total defeat and release all the evil from the otherworld. Now, the line between good and evil becomes blurred â€” only the consequences of our actions remain. The decisions are in our hands, and are good and evil just synonyms?
