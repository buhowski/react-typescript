# Shadows of the Cossacks: Saga

An epic game series that takes players on a journey through time: from the mystical Kyivan Rus of the 9th century, through the era of the formation of the Cossacks, to an alternative cyber-futurism. This is a story where the fall of religious institutions becomes the impetus for an unprecedented technological leap.

Through the destinies of mysterious heroes, religious conspiracies, ancient demonic cults, and otherworldly forces that shaped the world are revealed. It is a tale of the fight for freedom and love, the discovery of forbidden truths, and a choice that will forever change the future of humanity.

The world evolves from a mystical Middle Ages with magic and mythological creatures to a tribal scientific futurism. In each era, an indestructible cultural heritage confronts an ancient evil that constantly finds a new form, showing that the war never ends.
