# Shadows of the Zaporozhian Sich: Saga

My masterful saga is a sprawling epic and a journey through centuries, beginning in 9th-century Ukraine and leading to an alternative cyber-future. This is a story where the destruction of religion becomes the catalyst for extraordinary technological advancement.

Through the fates of mysterious heroes, we explore the depths of history, religious conspiracies, demonic rituals of the church, mysticism, and the otherworldly forces that shaped the world. This is a fight for freedom and love, the discovery of forbidden secrets, and a choice that will change the future of all humanity.

The world evolves from an authentic medieval period with elements of fantasy, magic, and demons into a tribal sci-fi futurism, where the magic of the past has been transformed into the technologies of the future. In different temporal realities, an undestroyed cultural heritage fights against an eternal evil that always finds its host, proving that war never ends.
