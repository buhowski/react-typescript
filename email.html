									Pitch
								</h2>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									I have a great desire to create a social platform (mobile application
									and web service) for potential development in Ukraine with the ability
									to go global. It's a new space of endless possibilities, a fresh air
									of freedom, a multifunctional product for creating anything you want,
									from technological innovation to personal improvement, all the best of
									everything in one place, things that make a difference!

									Summary
								</h2>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									I can offer a free and independent media with a voice of
									consciousness, novelty of ideas and large-scale production of
									world-class quality in the film and gaming industries, the idea of
									forming an IT sector that works on its own production.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									The strategy is based on the concept of an interactive magazine as a
									foundation for further development, focusing on production and
									highlighting these opportunities.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									The main uniqueness lies in the ideas behind it and the driving force
									that seeks to break free from the limitations and frames that current
									social networks or media makers gradually imposed on users.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									Ultimately, the goal is to transform ordinary media into a sphere of
									production and a resource from which this quality can be consumed.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									The flexibility of this idea allows its integration with any existing
									projects, so I am ready for collaboration or any discussion, as making
									the impossible is the main goal. There is a vision and theoretically
									it works.

									Basis
								</h2>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									Staffed, feature-rich magazine with the ability to create and promote
									any kind of activity with integrated author support. Also a place for
									browsing all sorts of information and entertainment. Mostly focused
									under a mobile app with an extended and accessible web site – on the
									outside, and on the inside – a huge potential of wanting to join the
									companies that are moving progress.

									Creative Production
								</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
									In general, my perspective is focused on the development of scale and
									collaboration of different spheres of activity, from innovative
									technologies to creative self-expression. And if we bring all the best
									and long-known things in one place and create a professional team of
									critical thinkers and enthusiasts, the jump in evolutionary process
									will happen all by itself, which will allow us to create a new history
									of culture, art and technological growth in Ukraine and world
									industry.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									Creation and re-engineering of the IT sector. Computer games
									development, making movies, cartoons (for which there are ready made
									ideas and scripts to start), studio of exact translation and voice
									acting, and gradual automation of all obsolete life processes.
								</p>

								>
									Journalism
								</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
									A new narrative of modern breathing, different opinions, truth and
									dirty realism. A peculiar presentation of information without
									censorship – direct, sarcastic, with the character of everyday
									language writing style, honesty and simplicity in describing life,
									featuring both heroes and anti-heroes.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									Gonzo Journalism, making story diaries from the first person or group
									of people, immersing oneself in events, becoming part of the history,
									an unpredictable and experimental style. Diving into the depths of the
									absurdity of an issue, studying it from inside, or creating specific
									conditions for its appearance. Subjects dealing with contemporary
									culture and social issues.
								</p>

									style="
										letter-spacing: 1.6px;

									Motive
								</h2>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									All current social networks have turned or are turning into “bygone
									era TVs'', with censorship to the point of absurdity and a stream of
									endless advertising all around that clutters the content. That's why
									we need to revise the obvious and create a new open platform, a shift
									in direction and breath of fresh air.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									For Ukraine it will be the first of such a place format, where
									everything will be focused on unleashing the creative potential of
									personality, freedom of expression and promotion of a modern world
									view. And the usual entertainment as well.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									This application will combine the best features in a convenient format
									– without unnecessary functions and useless things. With a stylish
									modern minimalist design and futuristic offshoot with maximum
									responsiveness to the consumer.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									In the process of further formation and the right approach to
									implementation, this place will perfectly occupy its niche for the
									production of all above listed and newly invented, becoming a leading
									area, a voice of consciousness, highlighting the desire to popularize
									the development in the country.
								</p>

									In very simple terms
								</h2>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									I want and can produce quality movies, games, virtual reality, become
									a voice of consciousness, implement artificial intelligence, robotics,
									study the human brain, and integrate it with computer technologies.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									Every company creates a website or a business card on the internet, I
									chose an interactive magazine instead, which can interact with people
									and, if desired, can be used as a social network and a resource with a
									donation system for creating their own content.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									The only thing I need for this is resources in the form of people or
									starting capital to build the foundation.
