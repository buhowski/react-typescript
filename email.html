									to go global. It's a new space of endless possibilities, a fresh air
									of freedom, a multifunctional product for creating anything you want,
									from technological innovation to personal improvement, all the best of
									everything in one place, things that make a difference!

												Creative Production
											</h3>
											<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
												In general, my perspective is focused on the development of
												scale and collaboration of different spheres of activity, from
												innovative technologies to creative self-expression. And if we
												bring all the best and long-known things in one place and create
												a professional team of critical thinkers and enthusiasts, the
												jump in evolutionary process will happen all by itself, which
												will allow us to create a new history of culture, art and
												technological growth in Ukraine and world industry.
											</p>
											<p style="margin: 0">
												Primary Plan: Creation and re-engineering of the IT sector.
												Games development, making movies, cartoons (for which there are
												ready made ideas and scripts to start) + studio of exact
												translation and voice acting.
											</p>
											<p style="margin: 0">
												Additionally: automation of all obsolete life processes and much
												more.

												Journalism
											</h3>
											<p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
												A new narrative of modern breathing, different opinions, truth
												and dirty realism. A peculiar presentation of information
												without censorship – direct, sarcastic, with the character of
												everyday language writing style, honesty and simplicity in
												describing life, featuring both heroes and anti-heroes.
											</p>
											<p style="margin: 0">
												Gonzo Journalism, making story diaries from the first person or
												group of people, immersing oneself in events, becoming part of
												the history, an unpredictable and experimental style. Diving
												into the depths of the absurdity of an issue, studying it from
												inside, or creating specific conditions for its appearance.
												Subjects dealing with contemporary culture and social issues.

									Why(?): Motive
								</h2>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									All current social networks have turned or are turning into “bygone
									era TVs'', with censorship to the point of absurdity and a stream of
									endless advertising all around that clutters the content. That's why
									we need to revise the obvious and create a new open platform, a shift
									in direction and breath of fresh air.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									For Ukraine it will be the first of such a place format, where
									everything will be focused on unleashing the creative potential of
									personality, freedom of expression and promotion of a modern world
									view. And the usual entertainment as well.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0; margin-bottom: 15px">
									This application will combine the best features in a convenient format
									– without unnecessary functions and useless things. With a stylish
									modern minimalist design and futuristic offshoot with maximum
									responsiveness to the consumer.
								</p>
								<p style="margin: 0">
									In the process of further formation and the right approach to
									implementation, this place will perfectly occupy its niche for the
									production of all above listed and newly invented, becoming a leading
									area, a voice of consciousness, highlighting the desire to popularize
									the development in the country.
